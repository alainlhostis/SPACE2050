  abstract = {This study asserts that contemporary cultural perceptions of wilderness have been heavily influenced by topographic cartography. It compares different historical conceptualizations of wilderness in the cartographies of Aotearoa New Zealand's Southern Fiordland, and finds that certain tropes have shaped how the region is now characterized and managed as an unspoilt, remote, threatened and culturally-empty wilderness. The author argues that this cartography-influenced understanding of Fiordland has come at the expense of other, experiential and phenomenological qualities of wilderness relating to participation and performance. The author explores alternative cartographies of wilderness with a particular emphasis on phenomenological engagement. Instead of tracing a route onto a uniform spatial scale, the reverse is attempted: a cartography in which intervals of time (hours and days) rather than space (metres and kilometres) are elevated as the primary axis of uniform determination. Then, a topographic representation is morphed to match these varying rates of travel: the resulting cartography, particularly as subsequent journeys are overlaid, reveals temporal dimensions that are as folded and contorted as the physically undulating terrain through which such journeys are made. Corner has critiqued wilderness landscapes as ``nothing more than an empty sign, a dead event'' (Corner 1999a, p 156). By contrast, this paper concludes that a phenomenological cartography may open up\textemdash through mapping wilderness's eidetic and temporal qualities\textemdash our capacity to understand wilderness areas as sites which are rich not only in ecological but also cultural relationships.},

  abstract = {Each movement technology alters the effective distances among places by changing the effort required to move things, people, and information among those places. Intercommunications media (postal, telegraph, telephone, telex. and computer-mediated techniques) have had greater impacts on effort distances than any other movement technology. Because they have not heretofore been examined carefully, the alterations of distance produced by intercommunications media have rarely been incorporated into geographical thinking. Geographical theory and analysis are impoverished by the failure of geographers to include the new ideas about distance and spatial interaction produced in intercommunications in their theory and their analytical models. Incorporating such ideas would enrich the discipline by making some of its most basic concepts more comprehensive and therefore more powerful.},

Usually, results are controlled for socio-economic differences and sometimes socio-psychological differences among respondents. However, these studies do not mention why after all a relationship should exist between travel behaviour and spatial, socio-economic and personality characteristics. Answering this query involves combining and linking theories stemming from transport geography (e.g. time geography, activity-based approach) and social psychology (e.g. Theory of Planned Behaviour, Theory of Repeated Behaviour). Using key-variables from these theories, this paper aims to develop a conceptual model for travel behaviour. Comparable to customary theories in transport geography, this conceptual model considers travel behaviour as derived from locational behaviour and activity behaviour. But the conceptual model adds concepts such as `lifestyle', `perceptions', `attitudes' and `preferences' which indirectly influence travel behaviour.},

Based upon a simple criterion for optimum navigation to the line-of-sight motion, a proper formulation is found in terms of the geodesic and normal curvatures of the missile path on the surface generated by the line of sight. By a suitable choice of a reference coordinate system, the missile-target kinematic relationships are then linearized, assuming relatively small deviations of the missile from a collision course. Upon combining these ``geometry feedback'' equations with the equations of guidance, the missile trajectory is found to be given in terms of two independent linear differential equations of identical form and of one higher order than the missile transfer function. Typical solutions are found for some simple cases. The character of the trajectory is shown to depend on an ``effective navigation constant'' proportional to the missile navigation constant (or gain) and the ratio of missile speed to closing speed; a value of this parameter greater than two is found to be necessary to insure finite terminal missile acceleration. Two example trajectories are calculated from both the exact and the linearized trajectory equations to indicate the accuracy of the linearization.},

  abstract = {Cette th\`ese porte sur l'hybridation des dimensions virtuelle et corporelle de la mobilit\'e. Elle interroge les effets de la mise en connexion de la mobilit\'e quotidienne, et en particulier de la mobilit\'e pendulaire, sous la double impulsion de la diffusion du smartphone et de l'am\'elioration de la qualit\'e de la connexion aux r\'eseaux de t\'el\'ecommunication dans les transports en commun. La mobilit\'e, que nous d\'ecrivons comme connect\'ee, permet \`a la fois le d\'eploiement d'activit\'es num\'eriques au cours du d\'eplacement, et l'acc\`es facilit\'e \`a une information personnalis\'ee sur les conditions d'un d\'eplacement projet\'e ou en cours via les applications d'aide \`a la mobilit\'e sur smartphone. La probl\'ematique g\'en\'erale de ce travail de recherche peut \^etre comprise \`a travers l'interrogation suivante : comment les usagers des transports en commun se saisissent-ils de la mise en connexion de la mobilit\'e pour agir sur les contraintes spatio-temporelles du quotidien ? Trois hypoth\`eses structurent cette recherche. La premi\`ere hypoth\`ese est celle d'un effet positif de la mise en connexion de la mobilit\'e sur la valorisation du temps de d\'eplacement. La deuxi\`eme hypoth\`ese est celle de la recomposition, \`a l'heure de la mobilit\'e connect\'ee, de la sp\'ecificit\'e de l'espace-temps du d\'eplacement au regard des activit\'es qui y sont d\'eploy\'ees. La troisi\`eme hypoth\`ese est celle d'une meilleure ma\^itrise de la mobilit\'e r\'esultant de l'ancrage dans les habitudes du recours \`a l'information personnalis\'ee au moyen d'applications d'aide \`a la mobilit\'e. \`A partir d'une enqu\^ete par entretiens semi-directifs r\'ealis\'ee entre 2013 et 2014 et d'une enqu\^ete par la passation de questionnaires en ligne en 2015, nous avan\c{c}ons, en r\'eponse \`a ces trois hypoth\`eses, l'id\'ee que la mise en connexion de la mobilit\'e soutient une banalisation du d\'eplacement. \`A d\'efaut de produire une valorisation du temps de d\'eplacement, le smartphone att\'enue, pour l'individu, les effets n\'egatifs des variations des conditions de trajets sur le niveau de confort du d\'eplacement. De plus, la mise en connexion de la mobilit\'e rend plus perm\'eable cet espace-temps au d\'eploiement d'activit\'es structurant par ailleurs le quotidien. Enfin, les applications d'aide \`a la mobilit\'e offrent, outre des voies d'optimisation temporelle des d\'eplacements quotidiens, une forme de s\'ecurisation de la mobilit\'e.},

The first section reviews current trends in urban and inter-urban individual travel behaviour in France over the past 25 years. The second section identifies three types of mobile services now available on the go: i) information services designed to provide assistance (choosing an itinerary, a means of transport, etc.); ii) access to new digital content in mobile situations, which significantly broadens the range of mobile activities and thus modifies the perception and use that can be made of transport time; and iii) the development of new mobile services supported by the advent of digital technology in the field of human transport. The third section discusses the implications of each of these services for travel behaviour, especially the use of various means of transport. Two types of effect are distinguished: optimization and sharing. The expectations placed on smartphones to regulate mobility on a collective scale have to be reconsidered in light of these effects.},

The results show that good estimates of dynamic quantities, such as travel times, train occupancy levels and origin\textendash destination flows can be derived from cellular data. The travel times, train occupancy levels and origin\textendash destination flows inferred from cellular data have been compared to direct field observations and Automatic Fare Collection data provided by the STIF (the public transport authority in the Paris metropolitan area).

  abstract = {Transportation systems exist within at least two types of space. One is the apparent geographic space, but equally important is the time\textendash space implied by the travel time relations created by the system. Differences between the geographic and time\textendash spaces are properties induced by the transportation system. Methods for time\textendash space transformations of geographic space to explore, visualize and analyze transportation systems were initially developed in the 1960s and 1970s. However, these methods have not been pursued beyond this initial flurry of research activity, most likely due to the difficulties associated with handling and processing digital geographic data. The rise of geographic information systems (GIS), as well as continued development and wider availability of transformation techniques such as multidimensional scaling (MDS) and spatial analytical techniques such as bidimensional regression can allow the potential of time\textendash space transformation techniques to be realized. This paper presents a general methodological framework that exploits recent advances in GIS, MDS and spatial analytical techniques. Results from applying these techniques to the Salt Lake City metropolitan area illustrate the power of these techniques to reveal spatial patterns in the travel time relationships induced by a transportation system. The application also addresses fundamental issues in time\textendash space transformations, such as two-dimensional versus three-dimensional solutions, Euclidean versus non-Euclidean solutions and symmetric and asymmetric solutions.},

Les diff\'erents syst\`emes peuvent sembler offrir des services \'equivalents pour les utilisateurs tandis que manquent souvent les informations n\'ecessaires pour mieux distinguer les diff\'erences entre tel ou tel syst\`eme. L'objectif de cette recherche vise, au-del\`a d'une pr\'esentation des diff\'erents syst\`emes guid\'es de surface qui structurent les r\'eseaux de transport public en France, \`a proc\'eder \`a une analyse comparative afin de mieux guider les choix des collectivit\'es territoriales, dans le contexte des efforts qu'elles conduisent pour promouvoir des transports urbains r\'epondant aux enjeux du d\'eveloppement durable. Les avantages et points faibles de chaque syst\`eme est analys\'e et pr\'esent\'e de mani\`ere d\'esagr\'eg\'ee. De mani\`ere compl\'ementaire, est propos\'ee et discut\'ee une m\'ethode multicrit\`ere ELECTRE III permettant d'agr\'eger les r\'esultats obtenus et de proposer le (ou les) syst\`eme(s) le(s) mieux adapt\'e(s) \`a diff\'erents contextes d'exploitation. Le r\'esultat principal met en \'evidence le fait que le tramway moderne sur fer occupe une place privil\'egi\'ee dans la majorit\'e des scenarii. Cependant, le CIVIS, le Translohr, TVR et m\^eme le trolleybus ont leur place selon le contexte d'exploitation, d\`es lors en particulier que sont pris en compte les co\^uts d'infrastructure et d'exploitation associ\'es. Les r\'esultats de cette recherche nous encouragent en outre \`a recommander, chaque fois qu'il y a un projet de syst\`eme de transport de surface, de passer en revue la gamme des syst\`emes et d'effectuer l'analyse comparative avec les diff\'erentes contraintes du lieu et du moment, en y int\'egrant une vision de moyen et long terme et les effets pr\'evisibles sur l'am\'enagement urbain},

  abstract = {Social and interpersonal connections are attached to the built environment: people require physical infrastructure to meet and telecommunicate, and then populate these infrastructures with movement and information dynamics. In GIS analysis, actions are often represented as a unit of spatial information called the social flow\textendash a linear geographic feature that evidences an individual's decision to connect places through travel, telecommunications and/or declaring personal relationships. These flows differ from traditional spatial networks (roads, etc.) because they are often non-planar, and unlike networks in operations systems (such as flight networks) provide evidence of personal intentionality to interact with the built environment and/or to perpetuate relationships with others. En masse, these flows sum to illustrate how humans, information and thoughts spread between and within places. Amid a growing abundance and usage of social flow data, we extend formal definitions of this data type, create new typologies, address new problems, and redefine social distance as the manifestation of social flows. Next, we outline challenges to fully leveraging these data with commercial GISystems by providing examples and potential solutions for representing, visualizing, manipulating, statistically analyzing and ascribing meaning to social flows. The goal of this discussion is to improve the dexterity of social flow data for geographic, environmental and social research questions.},

  abstract = {Tobler's first law of geography is widely recognized as reflecting broad empirical realities in geography. Its key concepts of ``near'' and ``related'' are intuitive in a univariate setting. However, when moving to the joint consideration of spatial patterns among multiple variables, the combination of attribute similarity and geographical similarity that underlies the concept of spatial autocorrelation is much harder to deal with. This article uses the notion of distance in multiattribute space to explore and visualize the connection between ``near'' and ``related'' in a multivariate context. We approach this from a global, local, and regional perspective. We outline a number of ways to combine different visualization techniques and introduce a new local neighbor match test for multivariate local clusters. We illustrate the methods by means of Guerry's classic data set on moral statistics in 1833 France.},

An application efficiently encodes the trajectories of bus GPS data in a time\textendash space cube and uses simple geometric methods to calculate and to visualize the headways and separation of buses on a bus route. These methods are discussed in detail. How they can be used as the basis of a software package that monitors performance measures for a variety of applications is explored.},

  abstract = {Phoenix adopted overlay zoning (an additional, targeted layer of regulations) in some light-rail transit (LRT) station areas at the site-selection stage to reduce planning-related uncertainty. This prompts consideration of advance transit-oriented development (TOD)--development that takes place before LRT system operation. In this paper we break down almost \$1 billion worth of advance TOD in the Phoenix area by type of TOD, type of station area, and use of overlay zoning. Factor analysis and cluster analysis are applied to GIS-based parcel-level data to identify five distinct station-area types. We then use ANOVA to verify statistically significant relationships between station-area type and: the value of advance TOD, the percentage of parcels with overlay zoning, and the percentage of advance TOD with overlay zoning. The five station-area types, ordered from highest to lowest advance TOD per station, are employment centers; Middle-Income Mixed-Use areas; transportation (park-and-ride) nodes; high population/rental areas; and urban poverty areas. Overlay zoning was used most in areas of urban poverty and least in station-area types with the most single-family housing. Advance TOD coincided strongly with overlay zoning in areas of urban poverty and least in employment and amenity centers.},

Cependant, certaines rues font l'objet de mouvements d'opposition \`a l'action publique et deviennent des terrains d'action dans les ann\'ees 1970, alors que les demandes adress\'ees aux services de voirie concernent des infrastructures mineures (marquage au sol, feux de signalisation).},

Using high-resolution data from OpenStreetMap and a satellite-derived time series of urbanization, we compute and validate changes over time in multidimensional street connectivity measures based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. We report on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975 in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi), based on every mapped node and edge in the world. Streets in new developments in 90\% of the 134 most populous countries have become less connected since 1975, while just 29\% show an improving trend since 2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the relative frequency of a street-network type characterized by high circuity, typical of gated communities. We identify persistence in street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent processes. Specifically, cities and countries with low connectivity in recent years also had relatively low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time period. We discuss implications for policy intervention in road building in new and expanding cities as a top priority for sustainable urban development.},

For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

It questions the view that tacit knowledge transfer is confined to local milieus whereas codified knowledge may roam the globe almost frictionlessly. The paper highlights the conditions under which both tacit and codified knowledge can be exchanged locally and globally. A distinction is made between, on the one hand, the learning processes taking place among actors embedded in a community by just being there dubbed buzz and, on the other, the knowledge attained by investing in building channels of communication called pipelines to selected providers located outside the local milieu. It is argued that the co-existence of high levels of buzz and many pipelines may provide firms located in outward-looking and lively clusters with a string of particular advantages not available to outsiders. Finally, some policy implications, stemming from this argument, are identified.},

It appears that subject variables (length of residence, travel experience, personality, short-term memory), touring variables (characteristic travel mode), environmental variables (complexity of urban form), and map variables (familiarity with and attitude toward conventional maps, type of mental map called for by investigator)-all contribute to levels of map performance as measured by quantitative content and/or veridicality analysis. The model proposed lists a number of operations such as motile and temporal synchronization, rotation, scaling, generalization, projection, symbolization and verbalization, which transform sensori-motor input into maps through coding, recoding, schema formation, and retrieval mechanisms.},

We identify the degree to and conditions under which High-Speed Rail is a viable substitute for airline travel. Using pooled cross-sectional data we estimate multinomial and mixed logit models to examine actual travel behaviour. Our model allows us to analyse the reaction of passenger behaviour on the withdrawal of aviation alternatives and the completion of the High-Speed Rail link between the two cities in November 2007. The results show that travel time and frequency are the main determinants of travel behaviour. The valuation of total travel times changes over the years following the opening of the High-Speed Rail link. Furthermore, we show that the direct elasticity of market share with respect to frequency for a number of aviation alternatives is above 1, indicating that these alternatives are not able to maximise profits. These alternatives subsequently left the market in our sample period. For the remaining aviation alternatives, except for easyJet, we find elasticities of market share with respect to frequency close to 1. Therefore, we conjecture that competition in this market will decline in the long run.},

  abstract = {La d\'ependance automobile des territoires p\'eriurbains li\'ee \`a une absence de commerces et de services pose la question de leur soutenabilit\'e, voire de leur durabilit\'e \`a l'aube probable d'une augmentation importante et continue des prix des carburants. Internet et plus particuli\`erement la vente en ligne sont en mesure de fournir une alternative propice au maintien des m\'enages dans ces territoires. En effet, gr\^ace au e-commerce, les m\'enages n'auraient plus forc\'ement besoin de se d\'eplacer pour disposer d'un ensemble de biens. En commandant en ligne et se faisant livrer \`a leur domicile ou \`a sa proximit\'e imm\'ediate (points relais, drive), les m\'enages voient s'accroitre leur accessibilit\'e aux biens qui leur faisaient en th\'eorie d\'efaut. Ce faisant, le e-commerce serait en mesure de participer \`a la p\'erennit\'e et \`a la durabilit\'e des territoires p\'eriurbains d\'ependants de l'automobile en reconfigurant les pratiques d'achats des m\'enages et les d\'eplacements qui leur sont associ\'ees. Si le e-commerce reste un canal de distribution minoritaire face \`a la grande distribution en France comme dans le reste de l'Europe (Diard et al. 2013 ; Eurostat, 2013), ses parts de march\'e ne cessent d'augmenter. A l'heure actuelle, peu de travaux se sont pourtant int\'eress\'es aux impacts potentiels d'Internet sur la reconfiguration des pratiques d'achats dans les territoires p\'eriurbains. Les m\'enages qui ont choisi d'\'elire domicile en p\'eriph\'erie de l'urbain ont-ils des pratiques d'achats en ligne sp\'ecifiques, diff\'erentes des m\'enages plus urbains et plus traditionnellement \'etudi\'es ? Pour le dire autrement, dans quelle mesure la vente en ligne participe-elle \`a la diff\'erenciation des modes d'habiter selon leur degr\'e d'urbanit\'e et \`a l'affirmation d'une durabilit\'e dans les territoires p\'eriurbains ? A travers l'analyse d'entretiens qualitatifs et d'un questionnaire sur les pratiques d'achats en ligne r\'ealis\'es, les uns comme l'autre, aupr\`es de m\'enages urbains et p\'eriurbains en C\^ote d'Or et en Seine-et-Marne, l'objectif de la communication est de montrer que des pratiques sp\'ecifiques d'achat en ligne participent \`a l'affirmation d'un mode d'habiter p\'eriurbain. En l'occurrence, les m\'enages les plus p\'eriurbains mobilisent l'achat en ligne afin de palier l'absence toute relative de commerces et services \`a proximit\'e imm\'ediate de leur domicile. Si pour les m\'enages urbains, le choix des possibles s'accro\^it de mani\`ere marginale, le saut est plus important pour les m\'enages p\'eriurbains. Plus loin, l'examen et la comparaison des pratiques d'achats en ligne montrent que l'achat en ligne participe \`a l'affirmation d'un mode d'habiter p\'eriurbain dans une logique de mise \`a distance croissante de l'urbain et d'un ancrage dans ces territoires. D\`es lors, en reconfigurant les pratiques de d\'eplacement associ\'ees, la vente en ligne participe pour ces m\'enages \`a la durabilit\'e et \`a la soutenabilit\'e de leur territoire de r\'esidence.},

  abstract = {Face \`a l'allongement des distances domicile-travail dans la majorit\'e des r\'egions urbaines fran\c{c}aises et au poids de l'automobile dans les d\'eplacements quotidiens, le transport ferroviaire de voyageurs est amen\'e \`a jouer un r\^ole cl\'e dans l'am\'enagement des territoires. La densification autour des gares des r\'eseaux ferroviaires r\'egionaux appara\^it comme une perspective cr\'edible pour des strat\'egies territoriales visant \`a b\^atir une ville renouvel\'ee sur elle-m\^eme, moins consommatrice d'espace et mieux organis\'ee autour des axes structurants de transport collectif, ainsi que le promeut la loi \guillemotleft{} Grenelle 2 \guillemotright{} du 12 juillet 2010. Cela implique de faire \'evoluer le regard que l'on porte sur les abords des gares et sur les potentialit\'es qu'ils rec\`elent. Si l'expansion d\'emographique du d\'ebut du vingti\`eme si\`ecle a conduit \`a ce que certaines gares soient progressivement rattrap\'ees par l'urbanisation, depuis les ann\'ees 1970, bien des villes desservies par le train se sont d\'evelopp\'ees en \guillemotleft{} tournant le dos \guillemotright{} \`a leur gare, au b\'en\'efice des r\'eseaux routiers et de l'essor de l'automobile. Depuis plus de dix ans, les R\'egions, en leur qualit\'e d'autorit\'e organisatrice du transport ferroviaire r\'egional de voyageurs, investissent dans le d\'eveloppement et l'am\'elioration de l'offre de services. Plusieurs d'entre elles ont connu une augmentation cons\'equente du trafic TER (Transport express r\'egional) sans n\'ecessairement que l'urbanisation se soit concentr\'ee dans les secteurs desservis par le train, tout au contraire (Beaucire F., Desjardins X. et S\'eguret S., 2011). Pourtant, nombre de territoires proches des gares TER constituent des opportunit\'es fonci\`eres int\'eressantes \`a mobiliser, en raison \`a la fois du gisement qu'ils repr\'esentent pour la production de logements et de leur capacit\'e \`a offrir des localisations qui pr\'esentent une moindre d\'ependance \`a l'usage de l'automobile. Les efforts pass\'es et \`a venir pour dynamiser les r\'eseaux de TER plaident donc pour que l'on se penche sur le devenir des abords des petites et moyennes gares, moins embl\'ematiques mais tout aussi importantes pour la mobilit\'e quotidienne et les politiques de densification que les grandes gares de centre-ville. R\'e-articuler le d\'eveloppement urbain avec le transport ferr\'e et mettre les gares r\'egionales au c\oe ur des strat\'egies territoriales n'est toutefois pas une d\'emarche \'evidente et interroge les modalit\'es de d\'eveloppement d'un urbanisme orient\'e vers le rail.},

  abstract = {For many, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and related libraries for programming languages define the terrain of geographical computing today. But what if GIS were locales within wider realms of geographical imagination systems (gis), realms more adequate to diverse theoretical commitments of geographical thought? Examining how various thinkers in spatial theory have conceived of phenomena, space, knowledge, and their entanglements, this article advocates for geographical imagination systems that change the infrastructures of geographical computation and broaden its associated objects of intellectual inquiry. In doing so, it centers questions such as: What if knowledge were understood as interpreted experience? What if phenomena were represented as individuated out of process and internal relations? What if spaces and coordinates were coproduced with phenomena? Interludes juxtapose such considerations with concrete possibilities realized by an experimental prototype geographical imagination system under development. As the article also argues, though, crucial to the future of geographic computation adequate to geographical inquiry will be diverse creative conversations in code (valued alongside and) intellectually interwoven with scholarly interventions made through mediums such as the written word.},

  abstract = {A mismatch between largely absolute Newtonian models of space in GIScience and the relational spaces of critical human geography has contributed to mutual disinterest between the fields. Critical GIS has offered an intellectual critique of GIScience without substantially altering how particular key geographical concepts are expressed in data structures. Although keystone ideas in GIScience such as Tobler's ``First Law'' and the modifiable areal unit problem speak to enduring concerns of human geography, they have drawn little interest from that field. Here, we suggest one way to reformulate the computational approach to the region for relational space, so that regions emerge not through proximity in an absolute space or similarities in intensive properties, but according to their similarities in relations. We show how this might operate theoretically and empirically, working through three illustrative examples. Our approach gestures toward reformulating key terms in GIScience like distance, proximity, networks, and spatial building blocks such as the polygon.

  abstract = {Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, {$\beta$}, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have {$\beta$} {$\approx$}1.2 {$>$}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display {$\beta$} {$\approx$}0.8 {$<$}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which {$\beta<$}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

For this purpose, the most recent works addressing the subject were reviewed and seven of the most commonly used measures were analyzed, investigating in detail their main properties and applications. Different experiments were carried out to study their relationships and compare their performance. The degradation of the results in the presence of noise was also considered, as well as the execution time required by each measure.},

The author makes effective use of simple, line drawings to illustrate the concepts introduced.Topics are presented with clarity and precision. The author's enthusiasm for his subject, and his desire to make it comprehensible to the widest possible audience are evident. It is a good foundation for exploring the more exotic aspects of physics, as presented by, for example, Close, Davies and Hawking. Suggestions for further reading are included as an appendix.},

Socially sustainable urban transportation is implied in the literature through the elements of social equity, social exclusion, and quality of life. Several well-established research areas provide potential theoretical, methodological, and applied insight into the development of future socially sustainable urban transportation research agendas, including: urban form, location- and individual-based accessibility, and city/regional planning for sustainability.},

  abstract = {Unlike the drivers of private vehicles, public transport (PT) users may perform secondary tasks during their primary travel activity. Moreover, Information and Communication Technologies may open up ``multi-tasking'' possibilities by allowing individuals to spend their travel time in more pleasant ways. This article proposes a tentative valuation of connectivity to mobile phone and Internet networks (MPIN) in PT, based on the stated preferences of 501 inhabitants of the Paris region. The surveyed individuals were presented with hypothetical trade-offs between travel time reductions and improvements in MPIN connectivity in PT. Econometric tests show that the values ascribed to better connectivity are higher when PT users perform various tasks with smartphones or tablets during their trips and when they experience a large number of connectivity problems in the reference situation. While heterogeneity between individuals has a minor direct impact, we propose a typology of PT users that captures variations in valuations. On average, the subjective value of travel time would be reduced by 12\% if PT users benefited from optimal MPIN connectivity whilst traveling. Alternative ``time multipliers'' \textendash{} for types of PT user, gradual connectivity improvements, different device-based tasks \textendash{} are also proposed. Lastly, we apply our results to a cost-benefit analysis of a current project in the Paris region PT.},

  abstract = {Au Qu\'ebec, comme ailleurs, l'int\'egration r\'ecente du concept de mobilit\'e durable dans le vocabulaire politique, technique, scientifique et citoyen depuis moins d'une dizaine d'ann\'ees marque un tournant. Le concept a des incidences th\'eoriques, mais \'egalement politiques et pratiques puisqu'il influence d\'esormais la mani\`ere de concevoir et de g\'erer l'espace et les d\'eplacements en milieu urbain. Si le concept de mobilit\'e durable est souvent assimil\'e \`a celui de transport durable sur le plan de la rh\'etorique, la litt\'erature scientifique nous indique la teneur des apories qu'une telle confusion suscite. En fait, cette apparition conceptuelle r\'ev\`ele qu'il ne s'agit plus uniquement d'am\'eliorer l'efficience des technologies et des \'equipements de transport existants afin d'assurer un niveau acceptable de co\^uts sociaux et \'economiques associ\'es aux d\'eplacements physiques et g\'eographiques des biens et des individus. La mobilit\'e durable est le pr\'elude \`a de nouveaux questionnements qui affectent le paradigme du \guillemotleft{} transport durable \guillemotright. Le concept de mobilit\'e durable participe donc \`a la remise en cause des approches techniques qui lui sont li\'ees et des approches plus conventionnelles que nous avons connues et accept\'ees jusqu'alors pour identifier, analyser et \'evaluer les enjeux li\'es \`a la planification des transports. Le pr\'esent article vise \`a contribuer \`a la compr\'ehension des diff\'erentes dimensions que couvre ce concept de mobilit\'e durable qui exige un effort de clarification. L'objectif g\'en\'eral de cet article est de mettre en lumi\`ere la singularit\'e du concept de mobilit\'e durable et ses implications particuli\`eres par rapport au transport durable. Seront ainsi identifi\'ees de mani\`ere syst\'ematique les relations qui unissent ces deux concepts ainsi que la nouvelle ligne de diff\'erenciation entre eux. Cette analyse nous permettra de consid\'erer la mobilit\'e durable en termes de changement paradigmatique qui nous enjoint \`a penser celle-ci au-del\`a de la planification traditionnelle du transport urbain.},

Map deformation techniques such as value-by-area cartograms are well studied. However, using deformation to highlight (dis)similarity between locations on a map in terms of their underlying data attributes is novel. We also identify an alternative way to represent dissimilarities on a map through the use of visual overlays. These overlays are complementary to deformation techniques and enable us to assess the quality of the deformation as well as to explore the design space of blending the two methods. Finally, we demonstrate how these techniques can be useful in several-quite different-applied contexts: travel-time visualization, social demographics research and understanding energy flowing in a wide-area power-grid.},

Dans le contexte de la construction des espaces de coop\'erations m\'etropolitaines bas\'ees sur des r\'eseaux de villes et une organisation polycentrique, le raisonnement n'est-il pas modifi\'e vers l'inscription de l'espace m\'etropolitain dans sa globalit\'e au c\oe ur d'un syst\`eme de transport int\'egr\'e ?

It requires identification of zones of origin, frequently defined by administrative boundaries, for surveyed visitors to a recreation site. More appropriate zones of origin, based on areas of constant time (i.e., an isochrone surface), can be generated using a geographical information system, although the quality of input data and assumptions about isochrone behaviour must be considered. Using surfaces generated under various scenarios, several models were created to predict visitor arrivals to a public-access woodland in eastern England. The analysis indicates that the approach is robust even under diverse model forms.},

  abstract = {The classical approach to the relation between rail and urban development takes the form of a circle of various radiuses (from 300 metres to 1 kilometre), centred on the rail station. The aim is usually to build more densely inside that circle. This method seems quite rough whatever the urban context, and particularly inefficient in areas of low density and scattered urbanisation. The following method is based on a GIS tool which seeks to establish the `real' accessibility perimeters determined by five minute and 15 minute journey times. This new and quite precise illustration of the different notions of nearness enables a coherent strategy of urban development to be elaborated, which takes into account both local road networks and land use. By first stretching the nearness perimeters around railway stations, before making the areas within such perimeters denser, a greater number of inhabitants can be accommodated and the whole population can be provided with a more convenient and sustainable environment oriented towards rail use.},

Remontant aussi loin que le permettent les donn\'ees, abordant des pays aux histoires contrast\'ees, nous \'evoquons deux grands types d'articulations : d'une part, l'\'evolution des r\'eseaux de transport permet un changement de dimension des villes et des syst\`emes de villes ; d'autre part, elle se traduit par une diff\'erenciation croissante des positions relatives des noeuds. Dans une premi\`ere partie, nous analysons les transformations des contours et des dimensions des villes rendues possibles par l'\'evolution des transports urbains depuis la r\'evolution industrielle, en t\'emoignant des d\'ebats passionnants qui agitent les contemporains depuis deux si\`ecles et les solutions envisag\'ees et parfois adopt\'ees par des organismes officiels pour suivre ces \'evolutions. Nous montrons que l'h\'et\'erog\'en\'eit\'e tr\`es grande des d\'efinitions nationales de la ville en Europe prend sa source \`a la fin du 19\`eme si\`ecle, lorsque certains pays font le choix des crit\`eres morpho-statistiques alors que d'autres gardent des approches juridiques et administratives. Dans une deuxi\`eme partie, nous nous appuyons sur une ontologie de la ville dans le temps long pour proposer des constructions de bases de donn\'ees urbaines harmonis\'ees pour la comparaison dynamique et internationale. Nos m\'ethodes sont notamment fond\'ees sur une mod\'elisation de l'emprise spatiale des villes selon un rayon th\'eorique correspondant, \`a chaque \'epoque, au budget-temps moyen des navetteurs. Les r\'esultats obtenus pour la France et les Etats-Unis r\'ev\`elent l'impact du choix des d\'elimitations sur les mesures du poids ou de la croissance des villes, et nous proposons des pistes pour construire des bases de donn\'ees harmonis\'ees pour les villes d'Europe. Dans la derni\`ere partie, nous montrons que les grandes phases de transformation des syst\`emes de villes co\"incident avec des innovations technologiques majeures dans les transports, m\^eme si des facteurs politiques et sociaux interviennent aussi (l'appr\'ehension de territoires \guillemotleft{} nationaux \guillemotright, la perception d'un espace de plus en plus relativis\'e par la vitesse de d\'eplacement). Dans les effets de dimensionnement des territoires par les r\'eseaux rapides, nous soulignons l'importance d'un \'echelon r\'egional, permettant, par des actions d'am\'enagement de grande ampleur, une structuration en r\'eseau des zones centrales de l'\'economie-monde. Par des mesures d'accessibilit\'e et de forme des r\'eseaux, nous mettons en \'evidence des processus historiques d'adaptation mutuelle puis de co-\'evolution entre r\'eseaux de transport et trame urbaine. Dans la phase de co-\'evolution, nous observons une diff\'erenciation croissante des positions relatives des lieux qui explique pour partie le processus de hi\'erarchisation des tailles de villes observable tant en Europe qu'aux Etats-Unis.},

The traditional role of distance functions has been to estimate travel distances or times in a given transportation system. We examine the properties of distance functions that make them useful in this role, and review popular ones such as the Euclidean norm, rectangular (or Manhattan) norm, and the more general weighted {$\mathscr{l}$} p norm and block norm. Statistical methods used to estimate the parameters of an empirical distance function from actual travel distance data are presented. This includes a review of the various goodness-of-fit criteria appearing in the literature, and a discussion of their error term distributions. The usefulness of empirical distance functions in modeling service systems of ever-increasing size and complexity, and their growing relevance in operational and strategic decision processes, are also investigated. Future areas of research are identified in closing.},

  abstract = {Policy decisions on transport infrastructure investments often require knowledge of welfare effects generated from using these infrastructures on a detailed regional level. This is in particular true for the EU initiative promoting the development of the trans-European transport (TEN-T) networks. As projects within this initiative affect regions in different countries, incentive compatible financing schemes cannot be designed without knowing where the benefits accrue. Furthermore, this initiative is also intended to contribute to the cohesion objective on a community scale, and only with regional impact studies one can assess to which extent these objectives are attained. As standard cost-benefit analysis is unable to assign benefits to eventual beneficiaries in the economy, we develop and apply a spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE) model as a suitable alternative. The model has a household sector and a production sector with two industries, one producing local goods, the other producing tradables. Regions interact through costly trade, with trade costs depending, among others, on the state of the infrastructure. New links reduce trade costs, which changes trade flows, production, goods prices and factor prices and thus eventually the welfare of households in different regions. We present the formal structure of the model, the calibration procedure and the data sources for calibrating the model and estimating the trade cost reductions stemming from new transport links. As the model is only able to quantify effects related to trade in goods we also suggest a simplified approach to add effects stemming from passenger transport. We apply the methods to a policy experiment related to the TEN-T priority list of projects. We quantify project by project the social return, check whether significant benefit spillovers to countries not involved in financing might prevent realization of projects in spite of their respective profitability from European wide point of view, and finally we evaluate the contribution of each project to the spatial cohesion objective. Our results confirm sceptical views on EU involvement in infrastructure policy that have been expressed in the literature.},

  abstract = {Background A group of UKexperts on Scientific Visualization and its associated applications gathered at The Cosener's House in Abingdon, Oxford\- shire (UK) in February 1991 to consider all aspects of scientific visualization and to produce a number of documents: \textbullet{} a detailed summary of current knowledge, techniques and appli\- cations in the field (this book); \textbullet{} an Introductory Guide to Visualization that could be widely dis\- tributed to the UK academic community as an encouragement to use visualization techniques and tools in their work; \textbullet{} a Management Report (to the UK Advisory Group On Computer Graphics - AGOCG) documenting the principal results of the workshop and making recommendations as appropriate. This book proposes a framework through which scientific visualiza\- tion systems may be understood and their capabilities described. It then provides overviews of the techniques, data facilities and human-computer interface that are required in a scientific visualiza\- tion system. The ways in which scientific visualization has been applied to a wide range of applications is reviewed and the available products that are scientific visualization systems or contribute to sci\- entific visualization systems are described. The book is completed by a comprehensive bibliography of literature relevant to scientific visualization and a glossary of terms. VI Scientific Visualization Acknowledgements This book was predominantly written during the workshop in Abingdon.

  abstract = {There is debate about the relative merits of investing in rail or express bus modes to improve regional transit performance. The debate largely assumes that both modes serve a single function of providing higherspeed service to the central business district (CBD) over relatively long travel distances. The debate generally overlooks other functions that might be served by express bus and rail transit modes and thus ignores that the two modes may perform differently depending on the service mission they are assigned. Performance of the two modes is examined in four metropolitan areas with different strategies for providing high-quality, regional transit service: a CBD-focused strategy, a hybrid strategy that serves the CBD and a few other destinations, and a multidestination strategy that serves a widely dispersed set of destinations. With a combination of route and system performance statistics and qualitative insights derived from key contact interviews, the performance of the express bus and rail transit modes in each metropolitan area, and among the set of metropolitan areas, was evaluated while the service mission to which each mode has been applied was considered. It was found that the combination of a rail transit backbone and a multidestination service strategy leads to better performance than any other marriage of mode and mission.},

We introduce an alternative model, where the map and the locations remain fixed, but edges are drawn as sinusoid curves. Now the travel time over a road corresponds to the length of the curve. Of course the curves might intersect if not placed carefully. We study the corresponding algorithmic problem and show that suitable placements can be computed efficiently. However, the problem of placing as many curves as possible in an ideal, centered position is NP-hard. We introduce three heuristics to optimize the number of centered curves and show how to create animated visualizations.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, Germany has improved the quality of its public transport services and attracted more passengers while increasing productivity, reducing costs, and cutting subsidies. Public transport systems reduced their costs through organizational restructuring and outsourcing to newly founded subsidiaries; cutting employee benefits and freezing salaries; increasing work hours, using part-time employees, expanding job tasks, and encouraging retirement of older employees; cooperation with other agencies to share employees, vehicles, and facilities; cutting underutilized routes and services; and buying new vehicles with lower maintenance costs and greater passenger capacity per driver. Revenues were increased through fare hikes for single tickets while maintaining deep discounts for monthly, semester, and annual tickets; and raising passenger volumes by improved quality of service, and full regional coordination of timetables, fares, and services. Those efforts by public transport agencies were enhanced by the increasing costs and restrictions on car use in German cities. Although the financial performance of German public transport has greatly improved, there are concerns of inequitable burdens on labor, since many of the cost reduction measures involved reducing wages or benefits of workers.},

  year = {2010},
  publisher = {{Routledge}},
  abstract = {Current societies face unprecedented risks and challenges connected to climate change. Addressing them will require fundamental transformations in the infrastructures that sustain everyday life, such as energy, water, waste and mobility. A transition to a `low carbon' future implies a large scale reorganisation in the way societies produce and use energy. Cities are critical in this transition because they concentrate social and economic activities that produce climate change related emissions. At the same time, cities are increasingly recognised as sources of opportunities for climate change mitigation. Whether, how and why low carbon transitions in urban systems take place in response to climate change will therefore be decisive for the success of global mitigation efforts. As a result, climate change increasingly features as a critical issue in the management of urban infrastructure and in urbanisation policies.  Cities and Low Carbon Transitions presents a ground-breaking analysis of the role of cities in low carbon socio-technical transitions. Insights from the fields of urban studies and technological transitions are combined to examine how, why and with what implications cities bring about low carbon transitions. The book outlines the key concepts underpinning theories of socio-technical transition and assesses its potential strengths and limits for understanding the social and technological responses to climate change that are emerging in cities. It draws on a diverse range of examples including world cities, ordinary cities and transition towns, from North America, Europe, South Africa and China, to provide evidence that expectations, aspirations and plans to undertake purposive socio-technical transitions are emerging in different urban contexts. This collection adds to existing literature on cities and energy transitions and introduces critical questions about power and social interests, lock-in and development trajectories, social equity and economic development, and socio-technical change in cities. The book addresses academics, policy makers, practitioners and researchers interested in the development of systemic responses in cities to curb climate change.},

While rapidly growing as an empirical phenomenon, our understanding of the nature and purpose of ULL is still evolving. While much of the existing literature draws attention to the aims and workings of ULL, there have to date been fewer critical accounts that seek to understand their purpose and implications. In this paper, we suggest that transition studies and the literature on urban governance offer important insights that can enable us to address this gap.},

This approach experienced a very fast development in the last few decades and penetrated into many other mathematical disciplines, such as group theory, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. The objective of this graduate textbook is twofold: to give a detailed exposition of basic notions and techniques used in the theory of length spaces, and, more generally, to offer an elementary introduction into a broad variety of geometrical topics related to the notion of distance, including Riemannian and Carnot-Caratheodory metrics, the hyperbolic plane, distance-volume inequalities, asymptotic geometry (large scale, coarse), Gromov hyperbolic spaces, convergence of metric spaces, and Alexandrov spaces (non-positively and non-negatively curved spaces). The authors tend to work with ``easy-to-touch'' mathematical objects using ``easy-to-visualize'' methods. The authors set a challenging goal of making the core parts of the book accessible to first-year graduate students. Most new concepts and methods are introduced and illustrated using simplest cases and avoiding technicalities. The book contains many exercises, which form a vital part of the exposition.},

This school developed a significantly new style of geographical inquiry, giving special emphasis to people's experience of place, space and environment and often using philosophical and subjective methodology.  This collection of essays, first published in 1980, brings together this school and offers insight into philosophical and practical issues concerning the human experience of environments. An extensive range of topics are discussed, and the aim throughout is to weave analytical and critical thought into a more comprehensive understanding of lived experience.

The model is characterized in terms of supply conditions of the different functions or bundles of goods produced at the different ranks of the urban hierarchy. Urban dynamics depends on the form of the net location benefits curve, in relation to urban size and rank, and it is constrained by demand or market size conditions. Both urban growth and decline are linked to the presence of location benefits and the appearance of innovations or new production.},

Then, we provide what could be considered as a range of actual cost values of building and maintaining a high-speed rail infrastructure. A similar analysis is carried out regarding the operating and maintenance costs of high-speed rail services. Some information on external costs is also provided. We finally deal with current demand and its projections, and try to draw some inferences about its future evolution.},

  abstract = {The private automobile is a central enabler for modern societies and is thus a culturally charged symbol. Can this societal promise of private car ownership and automotive mobility in the face of climate change and permanent congestion imply the continued guarantee of social participation? The digital options for transportation allow for a general safeguarding of mobility without the direct need for private vehicles, but the current market structures do not allow for that. It is obvious, that new business models triggered by digitalisation are struggling to find support in the current legal frameworks, although they increase the capacity and efficiency of transport and energy systems, reinforcing decarbonisation initiatives and eventually also address the citizens needs and interest in a more effective way. The dynamics of digitalisation are speeding up, eroding current patterns of mobility behaviour; the current legal framework, however, preserves the status quo and even contradicts the promise of social participation. Considerable restrictions on the private car need and will be implemented as urban and environmental pressures can no longer be mitigated. Electrification of the entire transportation sector is thus not only necessitated due to climate change mitigation, but is in line with the increased interlinking of different modes of transport into integrated mobility services. This shift will involve a fundamental transformation of the transport sector. It is driven not only by economic and technological factors, but importantly also by important societal developments and considerations. The use of digital technologies in order to economise the mobility sector, making it more efficient and intermodal, cannot be stopped. The automobile with its combustion engine was only the first generation appliance. Its broad success, however, has forced us to consider alternatives and reinterpret the product with the help of digital technologies.},

As has been observed over the past several years in other countries, the impact of HSR spans a wide range. However, few quantitative studies have been conducted to measure this impact. As a new attempt, this study uses accessibility analysis for quantifying the impact of China's HSR network. Weighted average travel times and travel costs, contour measures, and potential accessibility are employed as indicators of accessibility at the macro or national level. Forty-nine major cities in the HSR network are used in the accessibility analysis. Accessibility quantification and spatial distribution analysis for the study cities are performed on a Geographical Information System (GIS) platform. Accessibilities associated with varying availabilities of HSR, conventional rail, and airline are estimated and compared. The selected indicators and computational methods are found effective in evaluating the accessibility impacts of HSR from different conceptualization strategies and perspectives. They also offer complementary information on accessibility capacity of the study cities created by the HSR network.},

This radical shift also changes every aspect of our perspectives, including those on urban space and urban planning. With a brief introduction to the evolution of geometry, this article discusses the development of the way we think about and evaluate urban space. Such development is divided into two phases: homogeneous urban space and generalized non-Euclidean urban space, each with corresponding patterns of urban planning. Some key issues in the non-Euclidean pattern of planning are then explored intensively, such as varied measurements of urban land, geodesics in the city, and urban planning in spacetime. While emphasizing the way of thinking in urban planning process, this article provides some proposals that differ from those related to absolute space.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Transit-oriented developments (TODs) often consist of new housing near rail stations. Channeling urban growth into such developments is intended in part to reduce the climate change, pollution, and congestion caused by driving. But new housing might be expected to attract more affluent households that drive more, and rail access might have smaller effects on auto ownership and use than housing tenure and size, parking availability, and the neighborhood and subregional built environments. I surveyed households in northern New Jersey living within two miles of 10 rail stations about their housing age and type, access to off-street parking, work and non-work travel patterns, demographics, and reasons for choosing their neighborhoods. The survey data were geocoded and joined to on-street parking data from a field survey, along with neighborhood and subregional built environment measures. I analyzed how these factors were correlated with automobile ownership and use as reported in the survey. Auto ownership, commuting, and grocery trip frequency were substantially lower among households living in new housing near rail stations compared to those in new households farther away. But rail access does little to explain this fact. Housing type and tenure, local and subregional density, bus service, and particularly off- and on-street parking availability, play a much more important role. Takeaway for practice: Transportation and land use planners should broaden their efforts to develop dense, mixed-use, low-parking housing beyond rail station areas. This could be both more influential and less expensive than a development policy oriented around rail. Research support: Data collection and initial research were funded under contract with the New Jersey Department of Transportation.},

In order to explore the long-term evolutionary characteristics of land transportation in the BTH region, this paper utilized a temporal scale of 100 years to systematically interpret the development process of the land transportation network. Taking 13 cities within the BTH region as research anchor cities, we took into account ``leaping'' mode of transportation in order to investigate the evolution of accessibility. Our research shows the following results: (1) The land transportation network in the BTH region has undergone five stages of development: the initial period of modernization (1881\textendash 1937); the period of stagnation of transportation development (1937\textendash 1949); the network expansion period (1949\textendash 1980); the period of trunk construction (1980\textendash 1995), and the period of high-speed transportation network development (1995\textendash present). The network structure centered around Beijing has existed from the outset of modern transportation development. (2) The accessibility spatial pattern of land transportation in BTH region has evolved from expansion along traffic corridors to the formation of concentric circles. The stratified circular structure of transportation in anchor cities has gradually developed into a contiguous development pattern. (3) There are clear hierarchical differences in the transportation structures of anchor cities. Beijing has always been at the top of this hierarchy, while the hierarchical position of Zhangjiakou has fallen noticeably since 1949. The Beijing-Tianjin region was the first region to form a short-duration transportation circle structure, while the transportation advantages of the central part of Hebei Province, which is located in the center of the BTH transportation region, have yet to be realized.},

It did so both in its initial role in the sociology of bureaucracy and in its reinterpretation in institutional terms. More recently, there have been claims that the metaphors should change. The implications of this for the analysis of organization are the subject of this paper. To address these changes, we draw on debates that have been current in the sociology of consumption, where there is an emergent consensus that there has been a shift to an increasingly liquid modernity. We ask, what are the implications of liquid modernity when viewed not solely in the sphere of consumption but when we shift focus back to the sphere of production \textemdash{} to organizations?},

There are the mass transportation, which leads to introduction of rail-based transport systems (underground railways or trams) and that of distribution, which aims to provide a dense network of bus routes. These two major types of transport system have very different characteristics, in terms of costs and level and quality of service. This dual nature of supply opens the way for an additional level which is concerned with ensuring that the network is connected at nodal points which operate as multimodal exchange centres. This paper discusses the characteristics of this type of intermediate network, which is based on an indissociable triple association of equipment / infrastructure / level of service, as such a network has been envisaged in the case of the Lyon conurbation.},

It begins by classifying quantitative approaches to analyzing urban form into five classes: landscape ecology, economic structure, surface transportation, community design, and urban design. It then reviews quantitative measures in each class. Based on the review, four conclusions are drawn. First, over the last two decades substantial progress has been made in the ability to measure and analyze spatial patterns that help characterize urban form. Second, at multiples scales and for a variety of reasons, there are advantages to development that is mixed and compact. Third, normative principles and policies for addressing urban form need to be crafted at multiple scales and carefully designed to address the disparate issues that arise at each scale. Fourth, with so many disparate measures now used to operationalize the same constructs, it would advance urban form research to have some standardization in operational definitions and measurement protocols.},

  abstract = {Cities around the world attempt to imitate the Silicon Valley model by adopting public policies aimed at attracting new high-tech industries and Research and Development activities. The adoption of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) as elements in a public policy is based on the expectations of policy-makers regarding the potential to harness technology to ameliorate key urban problems such as a deteriorating environment, congestion or lack of communications between citizens and institutions. More specifically, policy-makers are exposed to knowledge about ICT, which is supplied by a variety of sources like scientists, popular media and their own experience. This paper argues that two gaps typify the flow of knowledge consumed by urban decision-makers: the knowledge gap, namely the uncertainty about the actual impacts of ICT on urban issues, and the communication gap which relates to the biases and noise emanating from the process of communicating knowledge between different actors on potential ICT impacts. The communications gap can, to a large extent, be explained by language and cultural differences between scientists and policy-makers. To illustrate and emphasise the gaps and their role in the ICT policy-making process, in this paper a comparison is made with the more familiar case of transportation policy making.}

It aims to understand how these concepts and methods have persisted and how they have contributed to shape the field of mobility studies. This question is rooted in an apparent paradox: a certain way of understanding and modeling daily mobility, the so called "classical method", has persisted for half a century despite drawing constant criticism. To explain this paradox, the scope of analysis must be extended to other major tools of transportation economics. For this reason I propose the concept of technical matrix, conceived as a system composed of three interconnected methodological devices. Assuming the existence of this technical matrix helps to explain the stability of the methods used to describe and model mobility, but also to understand the origin of the major concepts that structure the field of daily mobility studies.},

  abstract = {Transit-oriented development (TOD) arouses a great deal of interest as the interaction between transport and land use becomes a key topic in regional and urban planning. Even though accessibility is a key driving factor, it is barely assessed with accuracy. In Europe, the scope of TOD effects is large. It strongly influences the development of regional transport. Regarding that, this research brings forward a method that is based on multiscale accessibility measures to evaluate TOD strategy in a metropolitan European region. Hence, it proposes a multiscale accessibility method. On one hand, it introduces the pedestrian accessibility indicators at the local scale. On the other hand, it tackles the schedule accessibility measures in a constraints-based approach at the regional scale. This method is implemented in assessing the potential of TOD strategy in Nord Pas-de-Calais (France). For that, two TOD scenarios are presented. The first one tackles the main metropolitan center but does not include downtown. The second one deals with a second-order peripheral pole. These scenarios present difficulties in gathering both an effective local TOD and a sustainable development policy at the regional scale. However, a TOD center can enhance the intermediate scale urban centrality when using intermediate schedule accessibility measures (for coaches and buses). Furthermore, the indicators about the rail transit system highlight an uncertainty in the regional effects, which can only be solved by applying a major and expensive policy. The final remarks pave the way for further research regarding a full-fledged regional TOD strategy that includes a well-ordered dissemination of TOD centers.},

  abstract = {Many experts believe the transport system is about to change dramatically. This change is due to so-called fully-automated vehicles (AVs). However, at present, there are numerous important knowledge gaps that need to be solved for the successful integration of AVs in our transport systems, in particular regarding the impacts of AVs on travel demand. For instance, full automation will enable passengers to perform other, non-driving, related tasks while traveling to their destination. This may substantially change the way in which passengers experience traveling by car, and, in turn, may lead to considerable changes in the so-called Value of Travel Time (VOTT). Many experts anticipate the VOTT to decrease substantially due to AVs. However, the extent to which VOTT will change is currently far from clear. This study aims to develop new insights on the potential impacts of fully automated vehicles on the VOTT for commute trips. To do so, we first look at the existing microeconomics theory on the perceived VOTT and analyze the expected changes accrued from the effect of working and having leisure in an AV. We conclude that the VOTT of a work vehicle should be lower than what is experienced today in a conventional vehicle but the leisure one could stay the same. Then we conduct a stated choice experiment, specifically designed and administered for measuring the VOTT, and analyze these data using discrete choice models (DCMs). In total, we collected data from about 500 respondents. In the experiment, respondents were presented choice tasks consisting of three alternatives: an AV with office interior, an AV with leisure interior, and a conventional car. The same experiment was also given to another sample of respondents but this time describing a chauffeur-driven vehicle. Overall we find the average VOTT for an AV with an office interior (5.50\texteuro/h) to be lower than the VOTT for the conventional car (7.47\texteuro/h), however the AV with leisure interior is not found to decrease the value of time (8.17\texteuro/h) which confirms the theoretical results. The VOTT for the chauffeur experiment is systematically lower than for the AV experiment which we attribute to some distrust that people have regarding the AVs.},

In a very recent paper, a variational principle has been proved for models of the Generic Second Order Modeling (GSOM) family, yielding an adequate framework for effective numerical methods. Any model of the GSOM family can be recast into its Lagrangian form as a Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJ) for which the solution is interpreted as the position of vehicles. This solution can be computed thanks to Lax-Hopf like formulas and a generalization of the inf-morphism property. The efficiency of this computational method is illustrated through a numerical example and finally a discussion about future developments is provided.},

It increasingly creates major impacts on the environment (via surface sealing, emissions by transport and ecosystem fragmentation); on the social structure of an area (by segregation, lifestyle changes and neglecting urban centres); and on the economy (via distributed production, land prices, and issues of scale).  Urban Sprawl in Europe: landscapes, land-use change \& policy explains the nature and dynamics of urban sprawl. The book is written in three parts. Part I considers contemporary definitions, theories and trends in European urban sprawl. In part II authors draw upon experiences from across Europe to consider urban sprawl from a number of perspectives:  Infrastructure-related sprawl, such as can be seen around Athens; Sprawl in the post-socialist city, as typified by Warsaw, Leipzig and Ljubljana; Decline and sprawl, where a comparative analysis of Liverpool and Leipzig shows that sprawl is not confined to expanding cities; Sprawl based on the development of second homes as found in Sweden, Austria and elsewhere.  In part III a formal qualitative model of sprawl is developed. Policies for the control of urban sprawl and the roles of different stakeholders are considered. Finally, a concluding chapter raises questions about the nature and dynamics of these new urban landscapes and their sustainability.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates how and to what extent changes in user behavior may mitigate the environmental benefits of urban ridesharing, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ``rebound effect''. Ridesharing reduces both the individual cost of car travel (through cost splitting) and road travel times (by decreasing congestion). This may trigger a number of behavioral changes among transportation users, including: making less detours to avoid congestion (route choice effect), switching from public transit and active modes to the car (modal shift effect), travelling longer distances (distance effect), and relocating further from the urban center (relocation effect). Taking Paris region as a case study, this research applies an integrated transportation/land-use model to evaluate several ridesharing scenarios and quantify the four rebound effects. The overall rebound effect is found to be substantial, cancelling out from 68 to 77\% of CO2 emission reductions and from 52 to 73\% of aggregated social benefits (including congestion, air quality, CO2 emissions, noise) expected from ridesharing. This is primarily the result of the modal shift effect, supplemented as ridesharing develops by the distance effect. Although the simplified representation of ridesharing in the baseline model calls for caution regarding these estimates, a sensitivity analysis corroborates the main findings and the prevalence of substantial rebound effects. The paper also investigates to what extent three complementary policies - improving public transit, reducing road capacity or increasing the cost of car travel \textendash{} might limit the overall rebound effect and thereby maximize the benefits of urban ridesharing.},

  abstract = {This paper compares the effects of two prudential measures in housing access on the solvency and welfare of households, with specific attention to transport costs and equity issues. A widespread regulation limits the housing burden (defined as the share of income spent on housing), typically at 33\% or so. Using the monocentric model, I show that capping the housing burden drives low-income households away from the city center toward suburban areas, where they face high transport costs. This unintended eviction effect lowers the prudential efficiency of this measure. Capping the housing plus transport burden precludes this eviction mechanism and better protects household solvency, including from strong variations in transport costs such as during fuel price spikes. Additionally, by limiting the bidding capacity of households, both prudential measures lead to a decrease in housing prices. This tends to improve the welfare of households, firstly of high-income ones (being less affected by the constraints). The effect is stronger when capping the housing burden, so that households, again firstly high-income ones, are typically better off (in terms of welfare) than when one caps the housing plus transport burden, however. Considering the primary objective of prudential measures \textendash{} protecting household solvency, firstly of low-income households \textendash{} these findings call for the inclusion of transport costs within prudential ratios, as well as indicators of housing affordability. This would incidentally raise public awareness with regard to the high costs of private cars, which are often underestimated. A short application to the Paris region corroborates that a policy change from housing only toward comprehensive housing plus transport prudential ratios might significantly improve the situation of low-income households.},

  abstract = {La coordination des institutions, par le biais de la cr\'eation d'un p\'erim\`etre de transport unique, est-elle la solution la mieux \`a m\^eme de faciliter le report modal au b\'en\'efice des modes collectifs dans l'agglom\'eration multipolaire azur\'eenne ? L'inadaptation des r\'eseaux aux mobilit\'es actuelles engendre des probl\`emes aigus de gestion du transport public. Cette inadaptation repose sur l'inad\'equation des structures institutionnelles qui ne sont pas \`a la bonne \'echelle. Les p\^oles multiples doivent \^etre reli\'es \`a des r\'eseaux urbains interd\'ependants et cette n\'ecessit\'e s'accompagne de l'invention de nouvelles formes de gouvernement. Le travail comporte un premier chapitre pr\'esentant le cadre th\'eorique de la relation entre agglom\'eration multipolaire, institutions et organisation du transport dans un contexte spatial dense. En effet, les AOTU \'etaient, au d\'epart, distinctes, ce choix \'etant justifi\'e par l'\'etat de l'urbanisation lors de leur cr\'eation, mais elles g\`erent des territoires d\'esormais jointifs. Or, on ne peut imposer un p\'erim\`etre conforme \`a un bassin de vie, d'o\`u des inadaptations flagrantes.Un deuxi\`eme chapitre \'etudie les actions des autorit\'es organisatrices du transport public dans l'espace multipolaire azur\'een : la complexit\'e de l'organisation institutionnelle est-elle la proie d'un effet de fronti\`ere entre AO ? Le D\'epartement est en retrait face \`a la croissance des AOTU et notamment de M\'etropole Nice C\^ote d'Azur ; cela forme un espace politique inadapt\'e au contexte g\'eographique. Une nouvelle structure f\'ed\'erative, le SYMITAM, est cr\'e\'ee mais ne remplit pas son r\^ole de coordination ; devant seconder le D\'epartement, elle est mise de fait au service de l'AOTU la plus conqu\'erante.Enfin, gr\^ace \`a l'analyse des mobilit\'es et notamment par la mesure des actifs stables et sortants de chaque commune, et par les axes de TCSP, de TER et les p\^oles d'\'echanges qu'il serait n\'ecessaire d'implanter pour mieux organiser les interrelations entre le littoral et le sous-ensemble int\'erieur, un troisi\`eme chapitre propose une r\'esorption de l'effet de fronti\`ere par l'\'elaboration de nouveaux p\'erim\`etres institutionnels. Nous montrons les AO les plus \`a m\^eme d'organiser la gestion de ce nouveau format territorial afin de contrecarrer la parcellisation institutionnelle.},

  abstract = {Urban environments are restricted by various physical, regulatory and customary barriers such as buildings, one-way systems and pedestrian crossings. These features create challenges for predictive modelling in urban space, as most proximity-based models rely on Euclidean (straight line) distance metrics which, given restrictions within the urban landscape, do not fully capture spatial urban processes. Here, we argue that road distance and travel time provide effective alternatives, and we develop a new low-dimensional Euclidean distance metric based on these distances using an isomap approach. The purpose of this is to produce a valid covariance matrix for Kriging. Our primary methodological contribution is the derivation of two symmetric dissimilarity matrices (B+ and B2+), with which it is possible to compute low-dimensional Euclidean metrics for the production of a positive definite covariance matrix with commonly utilised kernels. This new method is implemented into a Kriging predictor to estimate house prices on 3,669 properties in Coventry, UK. We find that a metric estimating a combination of road distance and travel time, in both R2 and R3, produces a superior house price predictor compared with alternative state-of-the-art methods, that is, a standard Euclidean metric in RN and a non-restricted road distance metric in R2 and R3.

Further analysis was undertaken to examine the temporal changes in land use and related travel behavior over a 15-year period by comparing TTS data for 1986 and 2001. The results of the analyses illustrate quantitatively the strong association between convenient walk access, lifestyle, and transit use, not only during peak hours but also throughout the day. The results show how the promotion of focused development within a convenient walking distance of rapid transit service in a relatively low-density suburb of Toronto has, over 15 years, been accompanied by a substantial shift in residents' travel behavior toward increased transit use.},

  abstract = {n recent years there has been an increase in research on multiobjective shortest path problems. Objectives of interest have included cost, time, delay, accessibility, risk, reliability, and environmental impact, among others. In general, there is no single optimal solution in multiobjective problems but rather, a set of noninferior (Pareto optimal) solutions from which the decision maker must select the most preferred or best compromise solution as the one to implement. Single objective shortest path problems can, in general, be solved extremely efficiently. Unfortunately, the number of noninferior solutions to two objective shortest path problems may grow exponentially with the problem size. Consequently, the generation of the entire noninferior solution set is not practical for most real-world problems. The authors present a method to assist the decision maker in identifying the best compromise solution. The method incorporates interaction between the decision maker and the analyst to reduce the number of noninferior solutions that must be generated in order to identify the solution to be implemented. This interaction permits the decision maker to include additional criteria, values, and personal judgment in the decision making process.}

The MSPP is a bicriterion path problem with the objectives being the minimization of the total path length and the minimization of the total travel time required for demand to reach a node on the path. Potential applications of the MSPP include, among others, the location of new highways, railroad lines and subway lines and the design of airline routes. It is particularly applicable in transportation network design problems where the trade-off between operator costs and user costs is important. An algorithm is presented to identify noninferior solutions to the MSPP. This algorithm incorporates a K shortest path algorithm.

  abstract = {An application-oriented evaluation of the implications of fully automated driving is of growing importance, particularly with regard to future user acceptance and usage. One of the most remarkable benefits of fully automated driving discussed is the potential of alternative travel-time use. Radical changes in time valuation and a rise in productivity are being discussed, which are highly relevant when evaluating transport-related measures, infrastructure investments and mode choice behavior. However, the lack of empirical examination and the inclusion of important aspects about the usage context, constraints and perceived benefits make predictions difficult. This paper aims to bridge the gap by examining user acceptance and perceived 42 advantages of automated vehicles on the basis of four specific use cases within the course of a quantitative online survey in Germany. The study includes detailed information on respondents' current use of, and attitudes towards, today's available transport modes, as well as their perception of the advantages of automated vehicles. Special focus is placed on current and future travel-time use. Significant differences found in the adaption of specific use cases emphasize the importance of a differentiation of fully automated driving. Perceived benefits with respect to time use were mainly window gazing and relaxing, whereas the possibility of working seemed to be less valued. A probit model analysis examined influencing factors on the propensity of regarding working while traveling as an advantage - a strong significance of the current time use on public transport and long-distance train trips, gender and rational attitude towards public transport was revealed.},

  abstract = {This exploratory paper contributes to a new body of research that investigates the potential of digital market places to disrupt transport and mobility services. We are specifically looking at the urban freight sector, where numerous app-based services have emerged in recent years. The paper specifically looks at `instant deliveries,' i.e. services providing on-demand delivery within two hours \textendash{} by either private individuals, independent contractors, or employees \textendash{} by connecting consignors, couriers and consignees via a digital platform. The paper provides an overview of the main issues concerning instant deliveries, supported by data (including a survey of 96 courier delivery providers) and examples. After presenting a typology of companies (digital platforms) involved in `instant deliveries,' we question in what way they transform the urban freight current patterns. We highlight four issues, discussing their potential to impact urban freight services and related policies in European cities: 1) Freight trips and data; 2) Business models; 3) Labor legislation and work conditions; and 4) Local public policies. We conclude by saying that predicting the medium-term consequences of these changes is difficult, but it is essential that city planning and policies take account of these developments and consider how planning and possibly regulation needs to be adapted to these new ways of doing things.},

  abstract = {Cities are increasingly being challenged by traffic congestion and pollution. Enabling greater use of intermodal travel among inhabitants can be a way for a city to proactively meet these challenges. Currently, however, city planners are faced with an incomplete understanding of 1) what holds inhabitants back from intermodal travelling as well as 2) what could motivate inhabitants to adopt intermodal travel behaviours. Toward answering such questions, this study presents and evaluates research propositions regarding the shifting of city travellers' behaviours to intermodal travel. The extant literature, data from government and industry sources along with extensive qualitative primary data from eight in-depth expert interviews and twelve city traveller interviews are then drawn upon, analysed, and discussed in terms of policy and implementation considerations. Special attention is given to the role of information as a key contributor to overcoming change resistance and a potential behavioural motivator to engage in intermodal travel. Among the findings is the identified need for collaboration among mobility service providers to reduce perceived mode barriers and provide transparent information. Moreover, policy makers will need to focus on attractive incentives more than coercion mechanisms in order to sustainably motivate intermodal travelling. Tailoring the interventions and communication to different city inhabitant segments will also be the key to policy effectiveness. Overall, the study finds substantial support for the introduction of an online integrated intermodal information platform.},

In this paper we draw on these theoretical discussions in an attempt to interrogate the dynamics of competitiveness. We report on research to develop indicators to explore the relationship between sources (the initial stock of assets in a city) and outcomes of competitiveness (the result of attempts to exploit these assets by firms) across a sample of urban areas. We argue that urban asset bases provide a strong predictor of competitive performance in English cities, but that this general pattern is interrupted by some cities for which competitive outcomes are stronger or weaker than might be expected in light of underlying asset bases. The study findings provide some tentative methodological suggestions, augmenting the limited volume of empirically focused work regarding the means by which different aspects of the contested concept of competitiveness might best be measured. The findings also illustrate the differing competitive fortunes of major English cities and provide pointers with regard to priorities for policymakers in moulding and managing urban asset bases.},

  abstract = {The indirect environmental impacts of transportation disruptions in urban mobility are frequently overlooked due to a lack of appropriate assessment methods. Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) is a method to capture the environmental consequences of the entire cause and effect chain of these disruptions but has never been adapted to transportation disruption at the city scale. This paper proposes a mathematical formalization of CLCA applied to a territorial mobility change. The method is applied to quantify the impact on climate change of the breakthrough of free-floating e-scooters (FFES) in Paris. A FFES user survey is conducted to estimate the modal shifts due to FFES. Trip substitutions from all the Parisian modes concerned are considered \textendash{} personal or shared bicycles and motor scooters, private car, taxi and ride-hailing, bus, streetcar, metro and RER (the Paris metropolitan area mass rapid transit system). All these Parisian modes are assessed for the first time using LCA. Final results estimate that over one year, the FFES generated an extra thirteen thousand tons of CO2eq under an assumption of one million users, mainly due to major shifts coming from lower-emitting modes (60\% from the metro and the RER, 22\% from active modes). Recommendations are given to enhance their carbon footprint. A scenario analysis shows that increasing the lifetime mileage is insufficient to get a positive balance: reducing drastically servicing emissions is also required. A sensitivity analysis switching the French electricity mix for eleven other country mixes suggests a better climate change effect of the FFES in similar metropolitan areas with higher electricity carbon intensity, such as in Germany and China. Finally, the novelty and the limits of the method are discussed, as well as the results and the role of e-scooters, micromobility, and shared vehicles towards a sustainable mobility.},

  abstract = {Abstract  Railway stations function as nodes in transport networks and places in an urban environment. They have accessibility and environmental impacts, which contribute to property value. The literature on the effects of railway stations on property value is mixed in its finding in respect to the impact magnitude and direction, ranging from a negative to an insignificant or a positive impact. This paper attempts to explain the variation in the findings by meta-analytical procedures. Generally the variations are attributed to the nature of data, particular spatial characteristics, temporal effects and methodology. Railway station proximity is addressed from two spatial considerations: a local station effect measuring the effect for properties with in 1/4 mile range and a global station effect measuring the effect of coming 250 m closer to the station. We find that the effect of railway stations on commercial property value mainly takes place at short distances. Commercial properties within 1/4 mile rang are 12.2\% more expensive than residential properties. Where the price gap between the railway station zone and the rest is about 4.2\% for the average residence, it is about 16.4\% for the average commercial property. At longer distances the effect on residential property values dominate. We find that for every 250 m a residence is located closer to a station its price is 2.3\% higher than commercial properties.

The toolkit contributes to earlier implementations by combining aspects of both place-based and person-based accessibility measures. To this end, place-based accessibility measures are derived from a person-based framework by considering space\textendash time prisms that are centred at service facilities rather than individual anchor points. The implementation is also innovative by explicitly accounting for the opening hours of service delivery in its accessibility measurement. In addition, the toolkit is aimed to be user-friendly and to generate insightful and comprehensible results for non-technically oriented users, which is illustrated in a brief case study about library accessibility in Ghent (Belgium).},

In this exploration, we (1) compare OUIGO with the traditional French HSR and the low-cost airlines (LCAs), and (2) analyse fares proposed by OUIGO and its competitors. We thus analyse the new service in terms of production conditions, communication, marketing, booking, network geography, at-terminal and on-board experience and fares. We find that the railway industry's constraints (including market regulations, technical rigidities and incumbent employment relations) affect the OUIGO business model, which appears as a hybrid between LCAs and traditional French HSR carriers, although fares can be very attractive indeed.},

This dataset contains information on actually flown transnational routes, which allows for a thorough assessment of the chief connectivity characteristics of specific airports. Combined with information derived from a number of other sources, our results point to functional divisions among airports, both in terms of their geographical scale (e.g. national, regional, and international airports) and their specific role in the airline network (e.g. origin/destination versus hub airports). The implications of the results are discussed, and some avenues for future research are considered.},

  abstract = {The movement of people in space implies the consumption of resources such as time, space, money and energy, as well as the production of negative externalities such as accidents, pollution and congestion. Some of these effects have been analyzed on an aggregate level by comparing regions in the world, a set of selected cities and different geographical areas in a particular city. The analysis of data on a more disaggregate level that considers the differences in the cause and continuance of negative transport externalities among social classes and groups living in a particular city in the developing world is rare. This paper uses the S\~ao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) 1997 origin\textendash destination (OD) survey to investigate such phenomenon by taking advantage of the fact that data are divided according to six levels of household income. Results refer to mobility patterns in workable days. The main conclusions are that although people at the lowest income level spend a high share of their income on transport, they have a very low overall mobility and contribute almost nothing to transport externalities. At the other extreme, the two highest income groups that use cars intensively invest much more time, space and money to travel around and so contribute to transport externalities 8.4\textendash 15.2 times more than the lowest income group. Such large differences challenge current transport policies in developing countries and call both for a reassessment of assumptions and principles as well as for opposition to the propagation of myths that have sustained such inequitable policies.},

It is often the result of a very compound choice process that can take place consciously or unconsciously and that includes objective as well as subjective determinants. Despite its significance in our daily life, there is no uniform way to define and analyze the concept of modal choice. The aim of this review is to fill this gap by elaborating a common modal choice definition and by providing a comprehensive review on the concept of modal choice through linking it to Kaufmann's motility concept. By doing so, this review will not only contribute to an improved knowledge on different modal choice determinants and their interdependencies, but can also assist to the understanding and modeling of modal choice decisions. The review can therefore help increasing the effectiveness of policy measures taken by environmental, urban and transport policy makers.},

This paper focuses on how to use traditional survey mobility data for checking the satisfaction of users' needs. The dataset includes the mobility survey carried out in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area during 2013. The results aim to show planners and policy makers where to direct their policies and transport investments in public transport networks and services.},

Research into the effects of spatial configuration on the use of transport modes has to date dominantly been based on analyses of actual travel behaviour or prediction of future transport mode choices. However, in this research it is not made clear what choice opportunities were available for travel behaviour of the various population categories, given their desired activities and time - space opportunities. The authors describe a time - space theoretical and methodological framework based on the concept of action spaces, within which the choice opportunities of different types of households of various areas can be analysed. On the basis of a pilot study among the residents of a suburban neighbourhood in a Netherlands new town, the time - space opportunities they have to use alternative transport modes other than the car are brought into the frame. It is shown that residents have more time - space opportunities to make use of existing environmentally friendly, transport modes than had been expected. The possibilities differ between types of action spaces and types of households. Some implications for policymaking are discussed. The authors state that tlsb{$>$}policymakers should be more sensitive to interpersonal differences in accessibility.}

An ex-post analysis is carried out considering 161 routes EU-wide using transnational data. We use censored regressions with special attention paid to the presence of outliers in the sample and to the potential problem of non-normality of error terms. It is found that shorter HSR travel times involve less air services, with similar impact on both airline seats and flights. This impact quickly drops between 2.0- and 2.5-h HSR travel time. The impact of HSR frequencies is much more limited. Hubbing strategies led by the airlines have the opposite effect from HSR, as hubs involve more air services. Airline/HSR integration at the airport and cities being served by both central and peripheral stations have no significant impact. Metropolitan and national spatial patterns may help to better understand intermodal effects.},

The magnitude of these detours is assessed through a large, one-week sample of actual flight traces obtained from Flightradar, which we compare with great-circle distances (n\,=\,393,360). The results suggest that the average lengthening is 7.6\%, although under conservative hypotheses and with high standard deviation. The shortest flights are proportionally more affected. They also contribute more to the global amount of extra kilometres. The geography of detours by departure airport is the consequence of a wide range of factors. As a result, considering the use of great-circle distances to feed spatial interaction models, emission (or fuel burnt) assessments or airline rankings can lead to significantly skewed outcomes. In addition, detours imposed on certain airlines for geopolitical reasons increase costs, emissions and time aboard, and could be anticompetitive.},

  abstract = {This paper summarises the findings of a research project which analysed the impact of local administrative geography on the development of local rail transport policies in Merseyside and Strathclyde, two of the UK's Passenger Transport Authority (PTA) areas, between 1986 and 1996. The ways in which statutory local authorities and other public, private and voluntary sector organisations engaged in the policy process are illustrated in order to explain the development of specific policies. The differing spatial structures of the city-regional and joint board PTAs in existence over this period are shown to profoundly influence the aspirations of each PTA, the mechanisms of policy-making and the type of rail transport investment projects promoted. The implications of these differences for the accountability of each structure of local governance are outlined.},

  abstract = {The past 15 years has been characterized by a high density of record-breaking weather extremes in Europe. These include the extratropical cyclones Lothar, Kyrill and Xynthia across western and mid Europe; the major floods in the UK, Germany and eastern Europe; the heat waves in 2003 and 2007 and, after a long period of mild winters, the heavy winter seasons in 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. Inspired by the rising trends in weather-related damages worldwide and the studies on the topic carried out in overseas, the EC funded the sister projects such as Weather Extremes-Assessing the Impacts on Transport and Hazards for European Regions (WEATHER), EWENT and ECCONET to determine the magnitude of current and future risks to the European transport sector and to assess suitable adaptation strategies. This paper presents the assessment framework of the WEATHER project and the results of weather-inflicted damage costs now and in 2040\textendash 2050. Total annual damages are found to be around \texteuro 2.5 billion, which largely attribute to road traffic. However, broken down to passenger and ton kilometers the highest risk is borne by rail traffic due to its expensive infrastructures and its comparably complex operating structure. This indication even amplifies when looking four decades ahead: while average road transport costs will only raise by 7 \% due to milder winters, rail traffic costs may increase by up to 80 \% due to more floods and less predictable winter periods. A comparison with the results of the EWENT study uncovers a high range of uncertainty concerning methodological approaches and data treatment. Thus, the final figures might even be much higher.

In this paper, we created an international database for a large number of world cities and developed a way to map cost distance using conventional and Geographic Information System-based mapping techniques. The main result of this work is a set of maps showing the cost distances of world cities, which can be used as a significant source of information by world city network analysis.},

  abstract = {Institu\'e en 1993, le mouvement am\'ericain du New Urbanism prescrit \`a une \'echelle internationale un mode sp\'ecifique de connaissance et d'action sur l'espace urbain~: le mod\`ele n\'eo-traditionnel (Traditional Neighborhood Development \textendash{} TND). Celui-ci postule un lien organique entre formes urbaines et relations sociales, ce lien pouvant en particulier \^etre compris \`a travers la notion de paysage urbain. Partant de la distinction entre paysage de ville et paysages de l'urbain, cet article propose de comprendre comment la notion de paysage urbain est d\'efinie et partag\'ee par les acteurs du TND dans un contexte de mondialisation, de circulation et de concurrence des mod\`eles urbains. D'apr\`es l'exemple du townscape et du New Urbanism, l'article expose comment des standards circulent, sont l\'egitim\'es \`a travers des institutions ou des projets urbains tels que celui de l'agence DPZ \`a Berlin. En conclusion, il est montr\'e que les acteurs du TND, bien que b\'en\'eficiant d'un faible capital symbolique au sein du champ professionnel de l'architecture, ont n\'eanmoins r\'eussi \`a constituer un r\'eseau international promouvant une morphologie urbaine normative et historiciste.;The American-based movement of the New Urbanism was founded in 1993. It prescribes a specific mode of knowledge and action on the urban space at an international scale: the neo-traditional model, also called Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND). This model postulates an organic link between urban forms and social relations and this link can be understood in particular through the notion of urban landscape. Following the distinction between townscape and streetscapes, this article aims to understand how the notion of urban landscape is defined and shared by the actors of the TND in a context of globalization, circulation and competition of urban models. Through the example of the townscape and the New Urbanism, the article outlines how standards circulate and how they are legitimated through institutions and urban projects such as the project of the DPZ Company in Berlin. To conclude, it demonstrates that the actors of the TND have built an international network which promotes a normative and historicist urban morphology, although they have a weak symbolic capital in the professional field of architecture.},

The paper demonstrates the differences between geographical space and time-spaces at two different scales, such as the road network time-space of Hungary and a district of the capital city Budapest. With the first example the rapidly changing Hungarian time-space during the last two decades can be vividly demonstrated, thanks to new motorway construction. The second example compares different types of space, as for example the difference between the time- space of a pedestrian and a vehicle. (English)},

Full of fascinating detail, Ehn and Lofgren's work opens up a whole new field of inquiry."--John Gillis, author of "Islands of the Mind: How the Human Imagination Created the Atlantic World" "This is a beautifully written and elegant book, deeply thoughtful but accessible to anyone. "The Secret World of Doing Nothing "is an essential field guide for understanding daily life; a delightful way to find out what is going on in the heads of people waiting, standing in lines, daydreaming and seemingly doing nothing. Ehn and Lofgren open a door into a hitherto hidden world in the mundane details of daily life; they uncover a trove of valuable insight into contemporary society, emotions, and morality. Who would think that looking at nothing could be so enlightening?"--Richard R. Wilk, Indiana University "Focusing on three seemingly mundane activities--waiting, routines, and daydreaming--Ehn and Lofgren lead us into a rich imaginative world that lies within each of these everyday practices. Far from being trivial, we learn that these practices provide a revealing window into the social constructions of norms and values and moral debates about order and disorder. They provide a whole new level of insight into the collective nature of individual mental meanderings and the human desire to escape boredom and structures of control through the imagination." --Katrina Moore, University of New South Wales},

De l'\'ecologie urbaine \`a l'anthropologie de l'imaginaire, de la sociologie des modes de vie \`a la s\'emiologie de l'espace, nombre d'approches ont \'et\'e appliqu\'ees.

Les contributions au pr\'esent ouvrage montrent \`a quel point cette tradition d'innovation m\'ethodologique est plus que jamais d'actualit\'e. Diverses propositions illustrent en quoi la question des m\'ethodes est centrale dans la recherche, non seulement parce que les choix doivent \^etre coh\'erents avec la vis\'ee de l'objet, la perspective et les hypoth\`eses de recherche, mais aussi parce que l'utilisation de nouvelles m\'ethodes engage des d\'ecoupages originaux de l'objet d'\'etude et permet l'\'elaboration de cat\'egories d'analyse in\'edites. Chaque auteur a ainsi \'et\'e amen\'e, soit \`a revisiter des m\'ethodes d\'ej\`a disponibles, \`a repenser leur int\'er\^et et \`a tracer les limites de leur utilisation, soit \`a inventer, \`a construire une m\'ethodologie souvent composite, adapt\'ee aux perspectives th\'eoriques ou aux contraintes du terrain.

Satisfaction with travel has to date been assessed using utility-based models or measures of productivity of the trip. The present study is the first to assess the influence of activities performed during travel on public transport users' subjective well-being. To this end, a survey was conducted in Sweden in 2010 in which activities during the work commute by public transport were recorded and subjective well-being during travel was measured retrospectively using the Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS). Results show that talking to other passengers has the strongest positive effect on STS, whereas activities related to entertainment and relaxation lead to lower STS, possibly since engaging in these activities reflect unsuccessful attempts to abate boredom. In addition, it is found that activities during travel may have a more positive effect on the commute back home, suggesting that the mindset related to the destination influences travel satisfaction.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between multitasking during travel and the valuation of travel time (VOT). By building on the literature on travel time valuation and multitasking, both the attitude toward multitasking and actual multitasking behavior are hypothesized to have a potential impact on the VOT. The basic assumption is that if travel time can be used for other purposes or if it becomes more enjoyable as it is increasingly accommodated by information and communication technology tools, travel time is valued less negatively, and the VOT will be lower. To test these hypotheses, a stated preference survey was carried out among commuters in the Dutch Eindhoven region. With estimated discrete choice models, the analyses indicate that monochronic individuals, who dislike engaging in activities simultaneously, have a higher VOT, as one would expect. Commuters who listen to music while commuting have a lower VOT. Commuters who read for their work while commuting have a higher VOT, probably related to a more task-oriented attitude. Overall, the findings suggest that actual multitasking behavior and attitudes toward multitasking have a significant impact on the VOT and cannot be neglected in policy analyses.},

The operational definitions do not always comport with the qualitative definitions, and provide new insights into the nature of these urban design qualities. The immediate purpose of this study is to arm researchers with operational definitions they can use to measure the street environment and test for significant associations with walking behaviour. A validation study is currently underway in New York City. Depending on the outcome of this and other follow-up research, the ultimate purpose would be to inform urban design practice.},

  abstract = {The potential to moderate travel demand through changes in the built environment is the subject of more than 50 recent empirical studies. The majority of recent studies are summarized. Elasticities of travel demand with respect to density, diversity, design, and regional accessibility are then derived from selected studies. These elasticity values may be useful in travel forecasting and sketch planning and have already been incorporated into one sketch planning tool, the Environmental Protection Agency's Smart Growth Index model. In weighing the evidence, what can be said, with a degree of certainty, about the effects of built environments on key transportation ``outcome'' variables: trip frequency, trip length, mode choice, and composite measures of travel demand, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT)? Trip frequencies have attracted considerable academic interest of late. They appear to be primarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics of travelers and secondarily a function of the built environment. Trip lengths have received relatively little attention, which may account for the various degrees of importance attributed to the built environment in recent studies. Trip lengths are primarily a function of the built environment and secondarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics. Mode choices have received the most intensive study over the decades. Mode choices depend on both the built environment and socioeconomics (although they probably depend more on the latter). Studies of overall VMT or VHT find the built environment to be much more significant, a product of the differential trip lengths that factor into calculations of VMT and VHT.},

  abstract = {Transit-oriented developments (TODs) have been recognized as a promising proposition for policy makers and land developers in meeting the challenges of urban sprawl. The rapid pace with which TODs are being developed across the United States has left policy makers and transportation planners looking for methods aimed at modeling the travel characteristics of TODs. Current ITE trip-generation models are generally based on consolidated survey data from various land uses and are inadequate for serving the planning needs for travel demand parameters necessary to predict trip generation rates, develop trip distribution tables, identify mode choice characteristics, and determine trip assignment of TODs. The primary foci of this research were to understand the trip-making behavior of the TODs and develop a method for determining vehicular trip generation rates. A comparative assessment of TODs vis-\`a-vis non-TODs in relation to trip rates, transit usage, and primary travel mode was performed. A regression model relating TOD trip ends to gross floor area was developed and validated. Model behavior was consistent with the industry state of the practice; this factor would help transportation practitioners accurately forecast the trip generation rate for TODs. Validation of the regression model was performed by checks for normality, multicollinearity, and heteroscedasticity of the independent variable. The activity-based survey data used for this research were associated with the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, which provided a wealth of transit-oriented corridors and diverse land use. Use of these data mitigated the loss of computational information frequently caused by aggregate data and therefore provided a more accurate quantitative forecast.},

  abstract = {* 1I synthesize the understanding of the relationship between landscape structure and animal movement in human-modified landscapes. * 2The variety of landscape structures is first classified into four categories: continuous habitat, patchy habitat with high-quality matrix, patchy habitat with low-quality matrix, and patchy, ephemeral habitat. Using this simplification I group the range of evolved movement parameters into four categories or movement types. I then discuss how these movement types interact with current human-caused landscape changes, and how this often results in non-optimal movement. * 3From this synthesis I develop a hypothesis that predicts the relative importance of the different population-level consequences of these non-optimal movements, for the four movement types. * 4Populations of species that have inhabited landscapes with high habitat cover or patchy landscapes with low-risk matrix should have evolved low boundary responses and moderate to high movement probabilities. These species are predicted to be highly susceptible to increased movement mortality resulting from habitat loss and reduced matrix quality. * 5In contrast, populations of species that evolved in patchy landscapes with high-risk matrix or dynamic patchy landscapes are predicted to be highly susceptible to decreased immigration and colonization success, due to the increasing patch isolation that results from habitat loss. * 6Finally, I discuss three implications of this synthesis: (i) `least cost path' analysis should not be used for land management decisions without data on actual movement paths and movement risks in the landscape; (ii) `dispersal ability' is not simply an attribute of a species, but varies strongly with landscape structure such that the relative rankings of species' dispersal abilities can change following landscape alteration; and (iii) the assumption that more mobile species are more resilient to human-caused landscape change is not generally true, but depends on the structure of the landscape where the species evolved.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the effectiveness of two transit station-area development policies, park-and-ride (PNR) and transit-oriented development (TOD), by integrating a households' residential relocation model with a conventional four-step travel demand model. Scenarios are designed on an experimental network with a single candidate metro station to assess the effectiveness of: i) building a new PNR lot; ii) replacing an existing PNR facility with TOD; and iii) developing new TOD communities. In addition, the analysis is extended to multiple stations where PNR versus TOD comparison is made considering multiple station sites with the goals of maximizing the transit patronage and minimizing the vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and vehicle hours of delay (VHD). The system performance in each scenario is evaluated with utilizing various measures including transit patronages, VKT, and VHD. Results show that: i) deployment of a new PNR facility or a new TOD can considerably increase the metro ridership and reduce the VKT/VHD; ii) replacing an existing PNR with a TOD appears to be unrealistic due to a considerable ridership loss; and iii) impromptu station-area land use plan may result in network performance significantly lower than that of the optimal solutions. The proposed analysis framework can readily be incorporated in the existing four-step transportation planning tools to guide transit agencies in their decision on system-wide station-area land use plans.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates the spatial distribution of social activity locations. The research makes use of a social interaction potential (SIP) metric to estimate the potential for an individual to participate in a face-to-face social activity at any particular location in the city. The metric is shown to constitute a contact probability field that is sensitive to time-geographic constraints such as home locations, workplaces, and travel times. Empirical case studies drawn from samples in Ghent, Belgium and Concepci\'on, Chile are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the SIP metric in assigning high potential scores to observed social activity episodes. Moreover, a regression model is used to estimate the marginal benefit of using successive levels of constraint detail. The results illustrate both positive and negative aspects of the SIP metric. The metric behaves very well in general; 75\% of the time an observed activity location received a score in the 25th percentile. However, lower valued scores were more common in cases when the time-geographic constraints were not very strong (ie, when the commute duration was short), or when activities took place in the homes of the respondents. In the end, the results are a step towards validating the regional scale SIP metric and indicate that it may be useful in microsimulation models of daily travel and activity participation.},

Light rail transit can contribute to city boosterism - helping to enhance a city's image and quality towards broader development agendas such as economic growth and creation of sustainable and liveable cities. This paper examines the place-making role of light rail (supertrams, light metros and streetcars) through analysis of its material and meaningful impacts in relation to boosting city image and quality. It provides a critical synthesis of empirical ex-post evidence from a literature review of published and unpublished sources on wider economic impacts of light rail. Impacts include a modern image, reinforcement of cultural identity, prestige, social inclusion/exclusion, environmental quality, and physical transformations such as pedestrianisation and `greening' the city. More positive impacts than negative impacts were found, though these vary with geographical location and over time. Some cities deliberately seek to maximise impacts through integrated transport and urban planning strategies. The paper complements existing cultural approaches to transport geography to shed light on the relationship between transit development and city boosterism. The paper makes recommendations for future research.},

The interest of this research was to simulate, test and evaluate impacts of a Transit Oriented Development regional plan, using the LUTI modelling tool. Therefore were analyzed evolution of transport demand modal share and dynamics of real estate market and of localization choices of population and activities. TOD is a model of urban development that promotes high quality, mixed and multi-functional densification, located in proximity of transit nodes and corridors, with priority to non-motorized mobility and with the aim to reduce land consumption and car dependency. Multiple TOD examples can be found at urban and metropolitan scale, with different characteristics depending on the socio-economic and territorial contexts, while rarer are interventions at a regional scale. Therefore this research aim to analyze the application of a TOD regional plan, applied to a specific group of regional railway nodes and corridors, selected for their TOD potential. Results showed that some rail corridors initially selected, clearly confirmed their TOD potential and that TOD effects are more evident in areas with good basic levels of attractiveness and of economic dynamism. Furthermore, if policy of densification clearly contributes to concentrate residential demand in urban zones and to limit urban sprawl, further incentives has to be organized in favor of transit use. More interesting effects are in fact found by simulating transit integrated tariff policies between regional train and bus services, as well as interventions discouraging car use, in addiction to TOD urban configurations.},

  abstract = {In modern society, spatial mobility is highly valued with its relationship to individual freedom (freedom to travel anywhere at anytime, freedom to choose one's relationships, freedom of residential location, etc.). Spatial mobility has become so crucial that it has become an established ideology, putting pressure on individuals to expand their mobility and be able to adapt to spatial changes of living and working conditions (delocalisation of jobs, closing of local public services, etc.). In this context, the capacity to be mobile, or the notion of motility, is a deciding factor of social integration. How can motility be characterised? Which aspects must be taken into account in conducting a comparative analysis of an individual's motility? How does motility constitute a factor of social differentiation? Our article aims to render the concept of motility operational. Building on an exploratory qualitative study, we will explain the factors defining an individual's potential to be mobile within a geographic space in the perspective of the organisation of daily life. Three aspects will be discussed: the access rights portfolios each individual has developed, their aptitudes for mobility, and their representations that define the cognitive appropriation of transportation supply. The rationales explaining why and how the motility of individuals is created or unaffected are also considered. Finally, our article demonstrates that motility is indeed a form of capital, similar to economic, social, or cultural capital, present as a factor in social differentiation that modern sociology cannot disregard.},

  abstract = {Depuis les ann\'ees 1990, la question de l'\'equit\'e de l'acc\`es \`a la ville et aux am\'enit\'es urbaines a fait l'objet d'une abondante litt\'erature dans les domaines des \'etudes urbaines, de la planification territoriale, des transports et de la mobilit\'e, notamment au Royaume-Uni et aux Etats-Unis. L'\'etat de l'art fait appara\^itre un relatif paradoxe : alors m\^eme que les \'etudes sur l'accessibilit\'e, les r\'eflexions sur la d\'efinition de la notion d'\'equit\'e, les applications sur des terrains vari\'es se multiplient, la prise en compte des in\'egalit\'es sociales et l'usage de la notion d'accessibilit\'e dans le champ des transports sont aujourd'hui encore peu d\'evelopp\'ees. Ce paradoxe peut s'expliquer par une relative confusion entre les notions de mobilit\'e et d'accessibilit\'e, qui tend \`a assimiler toute am\'elioration des conditions de d\'eplacement quotidien des personnes \`a une am\'elioration de leurs conditions d'acc\`es \`a la ville. Un glissement s\'emantique est notamment sensible dans la vision qui consiste \`a faire de la mobilit\'e une condition de l'insertion sociale, ou \`a l'inverse \`a consid\'erer l'immobilit\'e ou l'incapacit\'e \`a se d\'eplacer facilement, qu'elle soit physique ou due \`a la pauvret\'e, comme un handicap auquel les politiques publiques doivent s'efforcer de rem\'edier. Pour autant, les indicateurs classiques de la mobilit\'e quotidienne apparaissent difficilement interpr\'etables tant en termes de qualit\'e de l'insertion sociale que d'in\'egalit\'es entre les individus ou de justice sociale et spatiale. Une mobilit\'e importante peut ainsi r\'esulter de contraintes fortes, telles que l'\'eloignement au(x) lieu(x) de travail ou l'accomplissement de programmes d'activit\'e complexes. Par ailleurs, une am\'elioration des conditions de d\'eplacement peut aboutir \`a moyen ou long terme \`a une d\'egradation de l'accessibilit\'e de certains individus, en raison d'effets non d\'esir\'es et souvent peu anticip\'es tels que les coupures urbaines, l'\'etalement urbain ou la gentrification des quartiers les mieux desservis par les transports publics. Au regard de la mesure et de l'analyse des in\'egalit\'es socio-spatiales, le recours \`a la notion d'accessibilit\'e pr\'esente plusieurs int\'er\^ets majeurs. Dans son acception la plus large, elle permet de croiser les dimensions de l'am\'enagement urbain (densit\'e, mixit\'e, colocalisation des activit\'es), des syst\`emes de d\'eplacement (qualit\'e et diversit\'e des services de transport, performance des r\'eseaux), des individus et des groupes sociaux (ressources, contraintes, besoins des personnes) et du temps (accessibilit\'e temporelle des am\'enit\'es urbaines, compatibilit\'e des emplois du temps). Par ailleurs, elle est directement interpr\'etable en termes d'in\'egalit\'es sociales et d'\'equit\'e spatiale. Enfin, du fait de son caract\`ere multidimensionnel, cette notion invite \`a la fois \`a un rapprochement des disciplines scientifiques et des m\'ethodes appliqu\'ees \`a l'appr\'ehension des in\'egalit\'es socio-spatiales et \`a un croisement des secteurs d'action publique concern\'es par cette probl\'ematique. En s'appuyant sur un \'etat de l'art des indicateurs d'accessibilit\'e et de leurs usages, cette communication explore les possibilit\'es et l'int\'er\^et d'un renouvellement de l'analyse des in\'egalit\'es sociales d'acc\`es \`a la ville. Apr\`es avoir soulign\'e la diversit\'e et les qualit\'es diff\'erentielles des indicateurs existants, nous pr\'esenterons les r\'esultats d'analyse issus de travaux r\'ecents. Puis nous poserons la question d'un changement des probl\'ematiques et de la construction d'une r\'eflexion multi-sectorielle dans le champ des \'etudes et des politiques urbaines appliqu\'ees aux in\'egalit\'es d'acc\`es aux ressources urbaines.},

Face \`a cette situation et dans un contexte de contraintes budg\'etaires, des acteurs publics ont pris la d\'ecision de mettre en place de nouveaux syst\`emes de transports en commun en site propre comme le tram-train. Il s'agit de la connexion d'un r\'eseau existant de chemin de fer r\'egional \`a celui d'un m\'etro l\'eger ou tramway pour offrir aux passagers des liaisons directes de transports entre le centre ville et la p\'eriph\'erie.

Tracing incipient change in travel behaviour is important for understanding the preconditions for social and environmental sustainability. We use data from the Swedish national travel surveys, conducted intermittently over almost 30years (1978\textendash 2006), covering both daily and long-distance mobility. International travel is included for the last decade. With respect to mainstream trends, the results primarily concern the continuation of the spatial extension of overall mobility and of the motorization and individualization of travel modes, as well as an upward convergence between women's and men's mobility. When it comes to countertrends, substantial reductions in daily mobility and long-distance domestic travel are observed among the young.},

There is a growing body of research supporting the hypothesis that travel time has some value of its own, and the proliferation of information and communication technology (ICT) may be contributing to that value. Travelers' attitudes are confounded with their mode choice, and as telecommunications mediate travel behavior, analysts must recognize the interaction between time use and customer satisfaction for appropriate travel demand management. To that end, this paper presents results from jointly estimated models of travelers' latent satisfaction and on-board activity engagement using Chicago transit rider data gathered in April 2010. The simple questionnaire and small sample corroborate the findings of past research indicating travel attitudes and activity engagement have potential to influence travelers' value of time, and many transit riders consider transit a better use of time and/or money than driving. The findings affirm the need for a more holistic understanding of value of time for travel demand management and infrastructure valuation. As time use has an influence on users' valuation of the transit mode, offering opportunities to conduct certain leisure activities could improve the perceived value of travel time.},

The paper concludes with a brief comment on three themes that should be made central to theorizing; the production of the urban habitat, the rise of civil society, and the question of power.},

Se fondant sur les mises en service de tramway entre 1985 et 2007, elle s'interroge \`a la fois sur ses effets sur la fr\'equentation du transport collectif, et sur celle de leur \'evolution diachronique au cours des deux d\'ecennies \'etudi\'ees. Les r\'esultats confirment que l'introduction du tramway a un effet fort sur la fr\'equentation, quoiqu'elle soit l\'eg\`erement sensible aux al\'eas conjoncturels.

  abstract = {TOD (Transit Oriented Development) is typically defined as a high density mixed area (residential and commercial) within easy walking distance of a high capacity public transport station (typically within an 800m buffer area). TOD is viewed as a set of strategies to increase the use of public transport, increasing walking activity, containing urban sprawl, and creating more liveable places. It is believed that this type of combined strategies will improve sustainable growth. This work is an exploratory work for evidence of TOD characteristics in train station areas in Azambuja train line, setting further methodologies to evaluate the success of TOD areas.},

  abstract = {Since the 19th century, a variety of "ideal" land-use transport systems have been formulated as optimal solutions to urban land-use and transportation problems (Wegener and F\"urst, 1999). Today, there is a broad consensus among researchers and transport/urban planning professionals that more coherence and coordination between transport and land-use policies is necessary to achieve sustainable urban development and mobility. This claim derives from evidence that, in Europe, local policies are only successful as regards criteria for sustainable development (the reduction of motorized traffic) when they combine measures for limiting car use in city centres with measures favoring the development of public transportation, densification, and mixed-use urban organization (Pharoah and Appel, 1995; Br\"og and Erl, 1996). If there is nothing new in the question regarding the interaction between spatial organization and transport, the ideas underlining this concern and the purposes of public policies have deeply evolved over the centuries, particularly as relates to urban planning. In short, we have moved from a concept of "car-shaped cities" to an approach to urban design where guidelines derive from "urbanity" values and the sharing of public spaces. How have local authorities translated the requirements and objectives of national laws? And how have they accounted for the evolution of these global objectives and the increasingly complex issue of coordinating urban development and transportation? What factors explain innovation and continuity in the relationship between land-use planning and transport policies? In this study we focused on the question of political change by comparing the "trajectories" of four urban areas: Geneva and Bern in Switzerland and Strasbourg and Bordeaux in France. Many empirical studies in political analysis have emphasized the importance of the long-term in identifying elements of continuity in political processes, assessing the reality of change, and stressing the interplay between national and local authorities (Fontaine and Hassenteufel, 2002; Kay, 2005). In this work, we have described the "policy paths" of the four aforementioned urban areas since the end of the 1960's by focusing on the contents of master plans, the principal technical solutions and projects that have been implemented, and the means of inter-sectorial coordination used. To do so, we have done a detailed analysis of numerous documents (laws, plans, technical studies, political documents, etc.) as well as semi-directive interviews with local actors. For each case, factors of change or inertia have been identified by focusing on three main variables that are often studied alternatively in public policy analysis: ideas, institutions and interests, or the "Three I's" as termed by Palier and Surel (2005). This paper presents the main results that emerged from a comparative analysis of these local dynamics. In exploring this first dimension, we have brought into question the influence of ideas, values, and standards on public policy and in the problem of the formulation or choice of solutions. We have shown, for instance, that urban or ecological values do explain differences in the ways of coordinating transport and land-use policies in Switzerland and in France; furthermore, this influence varies between cities based on geographical and "cultural" variables. We then focused on the role of the institutions (i.e. formal organizations) that regulate and structure local political systems. Our empirical observations led us to give less importance to the influence of institutional reform as a means of achieving more integrated policies: although institutions do influence political choices and explain differences among the four cities, we maintain that changing local institutions alone is not in itself an effective means of changing policies. The last variable concerns the interests of actors involved in political processes, as well as their strategic negotiations and interactions. We found that coordination between transport and land-use planning results from conflicts between areabased and reticular approaches to territorial development. Furthermore, we underline the role of economic factors in the negotiations between city centres and the suburbs, specifically in the context of cross-border urban areas (Strasbourg and Geneva).},

Using a structured procedure that had been refined after a preliminary study, more than 1,700 passengers were observed in London. The results showed that even when the length of travel is very short (2\textendash 6 stops), underground passengers engage in several occupations, especially those involving the use of mobile Information and Communication Technologies. These occupations depend on the specific spatial and temporal conditions of the travel, as well as on gender and age. These results should be useful in designing travel services that enhance passengers' experiences; they also suggest a criterion for comparing trips using different transportation modes (i.e., looking at the time point during the trip at which the ratio of active versus passive occupations changes).},

  abstract = {The paper addresses the paradox that people in modern societies believe themselves to be very happy and satisfied with their lives while simultaneously are subjected to increasing time pressure and pace of life. It starts with presenting evidence for time pressure covering objective and subjective indicators. Evidence for Germany is given by comparing time-budgets in 1991/92 and in 1999. Time use among full time employed in Germany and other EU-societies in the 1990s is compared to the US and Japan by means of diary-data. As regards work life, overwork and the gap between actual and preferred working hours are examined. Survey-results on the relationship between work load, time pressure, stress and health are reported. Most of these data support the conclusion that time pressure has emerged as a major social problem. Hence citizens are beginning to consider time prosperity as a dimension of their well-being beyond their consumer wealth. However, this growing pace of life does not reduce life satisfaction and happiness. Here a paradox evolves as increasing time pressure goes hand in hand with increased subjective well-being (SWB) at country level in cross-cultural comparison as well as at individual level. In the third section some answers to this paradox are explored: A first answer is offered through the modernization theory: life satisfaction and QOL are proliferating along with economic growth and living standards. This process at the same time accelerates social life. Hence, the negative effects of time pressure are counterbalanced by various yields of the modernization process resulting in a pattern of "heavy-going" satisfaction. A second explanation is the psychological approach: time pressure fulfils positive functions for mobilizing individual resources. A variation of this argument is that the multiple-choice-society offers a wide variety of attractive options resulting in people engaging in too many activities. Here, the enjoyment of life is equated with taking advantage of every opportunity. However, this paper prefers a third approach based on Simmel's explanation of the ambivalent consequences of modernity. Even where the majority of citizens report high levels of happiness and life satisfaction \textendash{} which can be explained through "arousal" or "eu-stress" \textendash{} the need to ease the time-burden of disadvantaged groups and to down-speed work and social life in general is essential.},

  abstract = {Cities are growing nowadays and so is their citizens' demand for mobility. On a global scale, motorized individual traffic is hardly capable of meeting this need due to its ownership costs and due to the lack of an accordingly large infrastructure. Besides, motorized individual traffic is responsible for the majority of today's traffic burdens, such as air pollution, traffic jams, noise, and accidents. It is thereby assumed that only a combination of soft transport modes and public and private modes of motorized transport with different capacities, time schedules, and operation times can achieve what is called ``sustainable cities''. Besides the need for coordinated transport services, their cooperation must be assured to obtain seamless interchanges and consequently undisturbed, fast, and reliable travelling. Such a use of different transport modes within a single journey is called ``intermodality'' and is a work topic fostered in a national, European, and world-wide context. This report shows the initial results of the project ``UrMo'' (``Urban Mobility'') that is being performed at three institutes of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The report gives an introduction to the topic by evaluating how socio-demographics and space structure influence intermodal behavior. In addition to this, the subsequent project steps are outlined.},

Thanks to the ready availability of online communication, travelers are now able to stay in continuous touch with friends, family and other travelers while on the move. This paper introduces the practice of `flashpacking' to describe this emerging trend and interrogates the patterns of connection and disconnection that become possible as corporeal travel and social technologies converge. Drawing on the concepts of `assemblages' and `affordances,' we outline several aspects of this new sociality: virtual mooring, following, collaborating, and (dis)connecting. The conclusion situates this discussion alongside broader questions about the shifting nature of social life in an increasingly mobile and mediated world and suggests directions for future research at the intersection of tourism and technology.},

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial-temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.},

There is however fairly little knowledge in the potential effects of bicycle-train integration policies. The aim of this paper is to examine the impacts of bicycle-train integration policies on train ridership and job accessibility for public transport users.MethodsWe extended the Dutch National Transport Model (NVM) by implementing a detailed bicycle network linked to the public transport network, access/egress mode combinations and station specific access and egress penalties by mode and station type derived from a stated choice survey. Furthermore, the effects of several bicycletrain integration policy scenarios were examined for a case study for Randstad South, in the Netherlands, comprising a dense train network with 54 train stations.ConclusionsOur analysis shows that improving the quality of bicycle routes and parking can substantially increase train ridership and potential job accessibility for train users. Large and medium stations are more sensitive to improvements in bicycle-train integration policies, while small stations are more sensitive to improvements in the train level of service.},

  publisher = {{Stanford University Press}},
  abstract = {In this major theoretical statement, the author offers a new and provocative interpretation of institutional transformations associated with modernity. What is modernity? The author suggests, "As a first approximation, let us simply say the following: 'modernity' refers to modes of social life or organization which emerged in Europe from about the seventeenth century onwards and which subsequently became more or less worldwide in their influence."We do not as yet, the author argues, live in a post-modern world. The distinctive characteristics of our major social institutions in the closing years of the twentieth century suggest that, rather than entering into a period of post-modernity, we are moving into a period of "high modernity" in which the consequences of modernity are becoming more radicalized and universalized than before. A post-modern social universe may eventually come into being, but this as yet lies on the other side of the forms of social and cultural organization that currently dominate world history.In developing a fresh characterization of the nature of modernity, the author concentrates on the themes of security versus danger and o trust versus risk. Modernity is a double-edged phenomenon. The development of modern social institutions has created vastly greater opportunities for human beings to enjoy a secure and rewarding existence than in any type of pre-modern system. But modernity also has a somber side that has become very important in the present century, such as the frequently degrading nature of modern industrial work, the growth of totalitarianism, the threat of environmental destruction, and the alarming development of military power and weaponry.The book builds upon the author's previous theoretical writings and will be of great interest to those who have followed his work through the years. However, this book covers issues the author has not previously analyzed and extends the scope of his work into areas of pressing practical concern.},

  abstract = {The inauguration of the Shinkansen high-speed train service between Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, at 210 kph maximum operating speed some 40 years ago marked the comeback of the train as an important passenger mode of transport. Since then high-speed train (HST) services have been introduced in many countries and are planned in many more, and the train has once more become the dominant mode of transport on many routes. This review summarizes the different elements of HST operation with the aim of characterizing HST operation and putting in context its impact in terms of what it is best designed for and what it can deliver. The review concludes that the HST is best designed to substitute conventional railway services on routes where much higher capacity is required and to reduce travel time, further improving the railway service, also against other modes, therefore leading to mode substitution. However, the high investment in HST infrastructure could not be justified based on its economic development benefits since these are not certain. Finally, the following definition for HST services is suggested: high capacity and frequency railway services achieving an average speed of over 200 kph.},

  abstract = {Intermodality, defined as using more than one mode for a single trip, is frequently discussed as a measure to help achieve more sustainable mobility in Europe, especially in cities. However, intermodality presents challenges for transport providers, and has its drawbacks for users, who prefer connections that do not require changing between transport modes. As a basis for forming recommendations to facilitate intermodality, we first analysed the status quo of intermodal mobility in four European metropolises: Berlin, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Paris. Subsequently, we conducted an expert survey in which we asked experts in the four cities about the future share and development of intermodality, its future relevance and potential of intermodality in transport planning, and how various factors on both the demand and supply side influence the level of intermodal activity. According to our findings, most experts foresee an increase in the share of intermodal trips. They also believe the relevance of including intermodality considerations in transport planning to be increasing. The increase of intermodal mobility will be driven by factors such as reduced vehicle ownership, but also by new mobility patterns. The latter can be explained by social factors such as urbanisation or digitalisation that affect the lifestyle of cities' inhabitants in future.},

  abstract = {The metaphor of a "cognitive map"has attracted wide interest since it was first proposed in the late 1940s. Researchers from fields as diverse as psychology, geography, and urban planning have explored how humans process and use spatial information, often with the view of explaining why people make wayfinding errors or what makes one person a better navigator than another. Cognitive psychologists have broken navigation down into its component steps and shown it to be an interplay of neurocognitive functions, such as "spatial updating"and "reference frames"or "perception-action couplings."But there has also been an intense debate among biologists over whether animals have cognitive maps or have other forms of internal spatial representations that allow them to behave as if they did. Yet until now, little has been done to relate research on human and non-human subjects in this area.In Wayfinding Behavior: Cognitive Mapping and Other Spatial Processes Reginald Golledge brings together a distinguished group of scholars to offer a unique and comprehensive survey of current research in these diverse fields. Among the common themes they discover is the psychologists' "black box"approach, in which the internal mechanisms of spatial perception and route planning are modeled or constructed, like metaphors, based on the behavioral evidence. Cognitive neuroscientists, on the other hand, have attempted to discover the neurocognitive basis for spatial behavior. (They have shown, for example, that damage in the hippocampus system invariably impairs the ability of animals and humans to learn about, remember, and navigate through environments, and studies in humans show that neurons in this system code for location, direction, and distance, thereby providing the elements needed for a mapping system.) Artificial intelligence and robotics theorists attempt to construct intelligent mapping systems using computer technology. In these areas, there is growing evidence that, as in human wayfinding processes, useful representations cannot be achieved without sacrificing completeness and precision. Wayfinding Behavior: Cognitive Mapping and Other Spatial Processes offers not only state-of-the-art knowledge about "wayfinding, "but also represents a point of departure for future interdisciplinary studies. "The more we know," concludes volume editor Reginald Golledge, "about how humans or other species can navigate, wayfind, sense, record and use spatial information, the more effective will be the building of future guidance systems, and the more natural it will be for human beings to understand and control those systems."},

  abstract = {La g\'eographie actuelle de l'emploi en \^Ile-de-France est le r\'esultat de plus d'un demi-si\`ecle d'expansion \'economique et de d\'eveloppement des zones d'activit\'es (ZAE). L'acc\`es aux zones d'activit\'es \'economiques est alors devenu un levier de l'attractivit\'e de l'espace r\'egional.  {$<$}h4{$>$}Des zones d'activit\'es \'economiques de plus en plus en p\'eriph\'erie de l'agglom\'eration parisienne{$<$}/h4{$>$} Les ZAE b\'en\'eficient g\'en\'eralement d'une offre de transport en commun. Mais la plupart des parcs d'activit\'es sont \'eloign\'es des gares, rendant ainsi obligatoire une correspondance avec une ligne de bus et des temps de d\'eplacement plus \'elev\'es que par voiture. La marche et le v\'elo sont souvent tr\`es p\'enalis\'es, en particulier par la pr\'edominance des espaces d\'edi\'es \`a la circulation routi\`ere, l'ampleur des emprises de stationnement et par les faibles densit\'es et la dispersion des b\^atiments. Les services propos\'es ne r\'epondent qu'\`a une minorit\'e de personnes, g\'en\'eralement contraintes de se d\'eplacer en transport collectif faute de disposer de v\'ehicule individuel.{$<$}br /{$>$} Am\'eliorer cette situation sur les ZAE existantes et en projet n\'ecessite d'agir \`a la fois sur la planification et l'am\'enagement urbain des parcs d'activit\'es et sur leurs conditions de desserte. Le d\'eveloppement des ZAE devrait s'appuyer sur de nouveaux principes en mati\`ere d'am\'enagement durable et d'int\'egration urbaine et environnementale. Ces principes devraient \'egalement guider les op\'erations de r\'ehabilitation des ZAE d\'ej\`a anciennes. {$<$}h4{$>$}Promouvoir des plans de d\'eplacements interentreprises (PDIE) plus respectueux de l'environnement et de la sant\'e{$<$}/h4{$>$} Les orientations en faveur d'une mobilit\'e durable pourraient contribuer \`a la mise en place d'une offre de services multimodale partag\'ee et mutualis\'ee avec l'ensemble des entreprises du parc d'activit\'es.

Les pratiques et les besoins des entreprises comme des usagers seraient ainsi mieux appr\'ehend\'es et les conditions pour susciter les changements de comportement de mobilit\'e seraient r\'eunies. Ainsi, ces nouvelles pratiques de d\'eplacement pourront contribuer \`a diminuer les d\'epenses de transport occasionn\'es par une moindre utilisation quotidienne de la voiture, \`a optimiser les co\^uts de transports pour la collectivit\'e, \`a r\'eduire les \'emissions de gaz \`a effet de serre ainsi que leurs effets sur l'environnement et la sant\'e, et enfin \`a am\'eliorer la qualit\'e de vie de ces espaces et des personnes qui les fr\'equentent.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper seeks to conceptualize and explore the changing relationships between planning action and practice and the dynamics of place. It argues that planning practice is grappling with new treatments of place, based on dynamic, relational constructs, rather than the Euclidean, deterministic, and one-dimensional treatments inherited from the 'scientific' approaches of the 1960s and early 1970s. But such emerging planning practices remain poorly served by planning theory which has so far failed to produce sufficiently robust and sophisticated conceptual treatments of place in today's 'globalizing' world. In this paper we attempt to draw on a wide range of recent advances in social theory to begin constructing such a treatment. The paper has four parts. First, we crticize the legacy of object-oriented, Euclidean concepts of planning theory and practice, and their reliance on 'containered' views of space and time. Second, we construct a relational understanding of time, space and dries by drawing together four strands of recent social theory. These are: relational theories of urban time-space, dynamic conceptualizations of 'multiplex' places and cities, the 'new' urban and regional socio-economics, and emerging theories of social agency and institutional ordering. In the third section, we apply such perspectives to three worlds of planning practice: land use regulation, policy frameworks and development plans, and the development of 'customized spaces' in urban 'regeneration: Finally, by way of conclusion, we suggest some pointers for practising planning in a relational way.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the implications of the 1998 UK transport White Paper for regional airports and air services within the wider context of the promotion of an integrated and sustainable transport system. More specifically, the discussion initially addresses the political and business context of the development of air transport in the UK regions. Secondly, the recent trends defining that development are isolated, particular attention being paid to the increasing importance of supplier-led strategies in air transport and the segmented markets served by regional airports. Finally, the three, not easily reconciled, strands, which can be identified in the White Paper's analysis of aviation are considered. These are: air transport's relationship with sustainable development; the integration of air transport with surface modes; and the contribution of air transport to regional economic growth.}

  abstract = {The global air transportation network is responsible for moving millions of domestic and international passengers each year. Not surprisingly, relationships between airports vary widely, due to a myriad of geographic, economic, political and historical determinants. Further, given the dynamic nature of the many influences acting on the air transportation system, inter-airport relationships and the structure of the global air network as a whole are also constantly changing. The purpose of this paper is to explore such spatio-temporal variations in the structure of the global airport hierarchies. Here, we show how the concept of nodal regions can be applied to measure the extent of these variations. To facilitate this analysis, a database of nearly 900 airline carrier schedules and 4650 worldwide origins and destinations, representing a nearly complete record of commercial air travel over a six-year period, is examined. Given this dataset, nodal regions are derived for all airports represented. In general, results suggest that regions associated with individual airports are often relatively dynamic at the yearly as well as quarterly level. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is utilized as a local case-study to provide a detailed examination of these dynamics.},

Accessibility impact of the new infrastructure is measured by means of three indicators: weighted average travel times, economic potential and daily accessibility. These indicators respond to different conceptualizations and offer complementary information about the issue accessibility. The results are quite different: very concentrated effects in the daily accessibility indicator, less concentrated in the economic potential one and more dispersal in the location indicator. The sign (polarizing/balancing) of these effects depend on the geographic scale: polarizing effects at the national level and balancing effects at both corridor and European levels are identified.

Building on consolidated methodologies for the assessment of potential accessibility, we estimate accessibility indicators at the zone level, evaluate how potential accessibility varies among income groups, and present evidence related to transport mode, in order to analyze social and spatial inequalities produced by the distribution of accessibility to employment and education activities. The research incorporates a method to evaluate how accessibility varies among zones according to average income and mode of transport in order to produce evidence-based arguments that can inform transport policy in the city-region of Bogot\'a, and other similar contexts in the Global South. Our results show strong distributional effects of the socio-spatial and economic structure of the city-region, its transport infrastructure and services, and the effect of current transport and land-use policies for citizens of different income groups. The tools and empirical evidence in this research seek to contribute to informed policy development in Latin America and other developing contexts, and feeding current debates on the role of accessibility in addressing social and spatial inequalities stemming from urban mobility.},

  abstract = {The connection between transportation and land use lies at the center of efforts in the United States to combat sprawl through smart growth strategies. Proponents of smart growth commonly make several specific propositions about the relationships between transportation and land use: (1) building more highways will contribute to more sprawl, (2) building more highways will lead to more driving, (3) investing in light rail transit systems will increase densities, and (4) adopting new urbanism design strategies will reduce automobile use. This article explores how well the available evidence supports these four propositions and provides an overview of the theory, research efforts, and current debates associated with each of these propositions. This overview shows that the four propositions have not yet been fully resolved: researchers have made more progress on some of these propositions than others, but even in the best cases, our ability to predict the impact of smart growth policies remains limited.},

  abstract = {Urban sprawl and the process of peri-urbanization have been important challenges for cities all around the world, generating car dependency. Public policies have taken up this issue with the aim of managing peri-urban mobilities by considering the opportunity of rail services through a sustainable approach. Indeed, the enhancement of the railway system has been at the heart of concerns of land use public stakeholders since the early 2000s. This paper suggests a specific approach to assess how rail may contribute to a sustainable management in peri-urban areas. It aims to analyse if railway enhancement is really a topic taken into account by all the stakeholders, whether they are inhabitants, elected representatives or representatives of economic societies. It relies on analysing the representations they have for peri-urban areas. Based on a specific methodological approach, it shows a certain convergence of interests in living near peri-urban railway stations, which could contribute to strengthen `urbanity' in a sustainable way.},

  abstract = {The adoption of Integrated Urban Models (IUMs) is increasingly being recognized as a tool to support transport policy appraisals in metropolitan areas. In Canada, the ILUTE (Integrated Land Use Transportation Environment) project is an IUM framework currently under development. While model development is undertaken by academics, the implementation of ILUTE is meant to occur within planning organizations thus rendering the success of model application dependent on available resources for modelling and planners' attitudes towards the role of models. In an attempt to render the ILUTE modelling framework more "policy-sensitive", a survey was conducted with planners and policy-makers pertaining to the three levels of government (municipal, provincial, and federal) in Canada. The survey collects information with respect to the current evaluation process of transport policy and its associated pitfalls as well as the desired state of policy appraisal and the need for more formal evaluation tools. Results show the presence of numerous challenges working against the proper development, adoption, and refining of models. The most notable of which include a general disbelief in the usefulness of models for decision-making, lack of resources for large-scale modelling exercises, and poor institutional integration among government departments. While local and national planning goals reflect the recent challenges of promoting environmental preservation, reducing social inequities, and improving the quality of life, modelling tools that can assess the impacts of proposed policies on these goals have lagged behind.},

  abstract = {This thesis aims to explore the importance of proximity and mobility, respectively, for individuals' accessibility, as well as the relationship between these two key spatial dimensions of accessibility in the context of everyday life. The thesis is based upon three empirical research papers which focus on accessibility-related preferences, actual accessibility conditions, and travel patterns. Focus is directed towards the spatial relationships between individuals' residential location vis-\`a-vis the location of a selection of different amenities including work, education, service and leisure functions as well as social relations. The analyses are based on a wide range of quantitative data, including questionnaire surveys as well as official register data for the Swedish population.      The first paper shows that residential proximity to amenities was most valued by individuals in the case of social relations and basic daily activities. The level of satisfaction with current accessibility conditions was generally high, with the exception of social relations where the findings suggest the existence of a `proximity deficit'. The second paper shows that observed average distances to most amenities have decreased over time (1995\textendash 2005). Concerning service amenities, the increases in proximity over the period were primarily due to a restructuring of the localization patterns within the service sector. A comparison of potential accessibility conditions and actual travel patterns revealed that people tend to travel farther than to the nearest amenity options, presumably to a large extent because of selective individual preferences, which may downplay the importance of distance in destination choice. The third paper shows that although the numerical supply of amenities within different spatial ranges has a significant influence on how far individuals travel for service errands, supply size alone is not sufficient for explaining travel length. The findings also suggest that although people tend to utilize the supply of amenities available locally, they are also willing to extend their travel distance in order to reach the amenity supply available within the region. Thus, even when there is a local supply, a rich regional supply may induce longer trips.      A juxtaposition of the findings of the three empirical studies suggests the existence of an `accessibility paradox' with several facets. First, although people express an affinity for residential proximity to many amenities, this is not necessarily reflected in actual destination choices, since minimization of travel distance is apparently not always a key criterion. This is also suggested by the conclusion that the spatial structure of the amenity supply alone accounts for only a relatively small part of the explanation of travel length, which is influenced by many other factors. In addition, actual travel distances show an increasing trend over time despite the concurrent reductions in potential distances. Second, the development over time indicates that the proximity deficit regarding social relations may be increasing in the sense that average distances have increased to many of the amenities considered important to have nearby, for instance adult children, but have decreased to those where proximity is not considered particularly important. Third, there is a discrepancy between the observed trend towards increased proximity to many amenities and much of the general discourse on accessibility, which tends to emphasize deteriorating conditions.},

  abstract = {The post-war era saw a dramatic decline in both the volume and market share of freight transported by rail in Britain. This decline was associated with the closure of thousands of rail freight facilities and reduction by one third in the route mileage of the national railway network. However, as a result of railway privatisation and increasing constraints on the competitiveness of the road haulage industry, the long decline has halted and rail freight traffic is growing. This article reviews the implications of this change for the demand for rail freight facilities and for extra capacity in the railway network, and considers how the land-use planning and transport planning systems might respond.}

Mary Helms explains how various cultures interpret space and distance in cosmological terms, and why they associate political power with information about strange places, peoples, and things. She assesses the diverse goals of travelers, be they Hindu pilgrims in India, Islamic scholars of West Africa, Navajo traders, or Tlingit chiefs, and discusses the most extensive experience of long-distance contact on record--that between Europeans and native peoples--and the clash of cultures that arose from conflicting expectations about the "faraway.".The author describes her work as "especially concerned with the political and ideological contexts or auras within which long-distance interests and activities may be conducted ... Not only exotic materials but also intangible knowledge of distant realms and regions can be politically valuable `goods,' both for those who have endured the perils of travel and for those sedentary homebodies who are able to acquire such knowledge by indirect means and use it for political advantage."Originally published in 1988.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

  abstract = {Identifying and measuring the land value uplift (LVU) impacts of rapid transit are important for a number of reasons. However, despite the general notion that rapid transit does confer positive LVU benefits, our comprehensive and critical review of more than 130 analyses across 60 studies completed in North America over the past 40 years finds significant heterogeneity in research outcomes, leaving many significant questions unanswered. Beyond high-level differences in study inputs, we argue that a fundamental source of variability is a lack of empirical specificity from the use of proximity as the dominant way in which LVU benefits are captured. This use of a proxy leads to the potential for omitted variables and unobserved relationships, and exposes previous work to the potential for misvalued results. To overcome this issue, we outline recommendations for future research, namely a recognition of relative accessibility and the possibility of LVU impacts from transit-oriented development. Incorporating measures related to these factors into LVU models can reveal their implicit prices, resulting in research that is more theoretically inclusive, empirically comprehensive, comparable, and able to provide important information to inform policy analysis and prescription.},

  abstract = {A distance cartogram (DC) is a technique that alters distances between a user-specified origin and the other locations in a map with respect to travel time. With DC, users can weigh the relative travel time costs between the origin and potential destinations at a glance because travel times are projected in a linearly interpolated time space from the origin. Such glance-ability is known to be useful for travelers who are mindful of travel time when finding their travel destinations. When constructing DC, however, uneven urban traffic conditions introduce excessive distortion and challenge user intuition. In addition, there has been little research focusing on DC's user interaction design. To tackle these challenges and realize the potential of DC as an interactive decision-making support tool, we derive a set of useful interactions through two formative studies and devise two novel techniques called Geo-contextual Anchoring Projection and Scalable Road-network Construction. We develop an interactive map system using these techniques and evaluate this system by comparing it against an equidistant map (EM), a widely used conventional layout that preserves the geographical reality. Based on the analysis of user behavior and qualitative feedback, we identify several benefits of using DC itself and of the interaction techniques we derived. We also analyze the specific reasons behind these identified benefits.},

Although studies show that users can efficiently assess travel time with DC, distortion applied in DC may confuse users, and its usefulness "in the wild" is unknown. To understand how real world users perceive DC's benefits and drawbacks, we devise techniques that improve DC's presentation (preserving topological relationships among map features while aiming at retaining shapes) and scalability (presenting accurate live travel time). We developed a DC-enabled system with these techniques, and deployed it to 20 participants for 4 weeks. During this period, participants spent, on average, more than 50\% of their time with DC as opposed to a standard map. Participants felt DC to be intuitive and useful for assessing travel time. They indicated intent in adopting DC in their real-life scenarios.},

This urban planning concept proposes a city where residents can meet their essential needs within a short walking or cycling trip from their home. Local access to grocery stores is a necessary component for cities to achieve the 15-minute city. This study aims to evaluate local accessibility to grocery stores by walking and cycling in the City of Vancouver. We used a cumulative opportunity measure to count the number of grocery stores available within a 15-minute walk and cycle from people's homes. To evaluate accessibility from the perspective of younger and older travellers, we considered different travel speeds. Our results show there is good accessibility to grocery stores when cycling, with less than 1\% of the city's population not having a grocery store within a 15-minute cycle. When assuming a walking speed of an older pedestrian, around one-fifth of the population did not have access to a grocery store in their local area. The neighbourhoods that did not have a store within a 15-minute walk had higher proportions of children, older adults, and visible minorities, and lower rates of employment and post-secondary education attainment. In seeking to improve accessibility via walking and cycling, cities should prioritize grocery store locations and investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure to underserved neighbourhoods and populations.},

  abstract = {Recent research on the assessment of transit-oriented development (TOD) has focused on individual transit nodes. However, we argue that having such a TOD level value is not sufficient to understand the role each transit node plays within a TOD network. In other words, a transit node may have a low performance when evaluating its individual TOD level, but it may serve an important role within the TOD network, for example, as a feeder node. In this paper, a TOD typology was developed based on built-form indicators to identify the roles different types of nodes play within the transit network and to discuss complementarity effects between TOD nodes within the TOD network. The study area is the Arnhem-Nijmegen city region in the Netherlands, which has a TOD network of 22 train stations. Results identified three types of roles: suburban residential, characterized by low population and job densities; urban residential, marked by low destination accessibility and low diversity of land-uses; and urban mixed core, which featured higher densities of jobs, population, and diversity of land uses. Based on the TOD typology, a correspondence analysis was conducted to measure the potential complementarity effect of the TOD network system, i.e., the extent to which nodes in different typologies can complement each other to strengthen the characteristics of the TOD as a network. The results illustrated that differentiation among the TOD nodes in terms of residential housing prices and building uses contributed to a more diversified offer in terms of activities and functions of the TOD region and indicates complementarity between stations. Thus, TOD should be assessed and planned in a network system perspective, with the understanding that the nodes are pieces that contribute to the performance of the network.},

  abstract = {An axiomatic approach to distance is developed which focuses on those behavioral concepts of distance related to movement in space. In particular, spatial movement by behaving units is postulated to involve a choice from among some set of abstract trips in space, and implicitly, to involve the minimization of some relevant notion of trip costs. In this context, the relevant behavioral notion of distance in space is taken to be the minimum-cost distance generated by this choice process. These trip-cost concepts extend the classical notions of paths, path lengths, and shortest paths in metric spaces. Hence many of the analytical results of the paper involve extensions of classical shortest-path distance properties to minimum-cost distances. In addition to these extensions, a characterization theorem is given which specifies the possible functional relationships between trip costs and their associated path lengths. These relationships include most functional forms which are commonly employed in the literature.},

  abstract = {Among the attempts made worldwide to foster urban and transport sustainability, transit-oriented development (TOD) certainly is one of the most successful. Since the TOD concept appeared in the late 1980s, it has received increasing attention from researchers and practitioners as a way to merge together transport engineering and planning, land-use planning, and urban design for providing comprehensive solutions to contemporary urban problems. This attention has notably led to the publication of over 300 articles explicitly concerned with TOD in Web of Science journals, as well as to many implementations of the concept, some already completed and others underway (as, for example, the Grand Paris Project in France and Moscow Central Circle in Russia). Essentially, TOD can be described as land-use and transport planning that makes sustainable transport modes convenient and desirable, and that maximizes the efficiency of transport services by concentrating urban development around transit stations. However, as TOD projects started to be implemented worldwide, it became evident that their outcomes could be quite diverse, revealing that in practice the results of a project would depend on a wide variety of factors, trends and complex interrelations between them. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive, systematic and up-to-date review of TOD research achievements and challenges. We start by presenting the TOD concept, framing it in the theory of urban planning, and by describing the different typologies of TOD proposed in the literature. Then, we review the vast research dedicated to the study of TOD effects, distinguishing impacts on travel behavior, real-estate prices, residential location, urban form, and community life. The next subject we look at is TOD planning, focusing separately on policy issues and decision-support tools. In the final part of the article, based on the analysis of previous literature, we identify the main gaps and challenges that TOD research needs to address in the future.},

  abstract = {What do walking, weaving, observing, storytelling, singing, drawing and writing have in common? The answer is that they all proceed along lines. In this extraordinary book Tim Ingold imagines a world in which everyone and everything consists of interwoven or interconnected lines and lays the foundations for a completely new discipline: the anthropological archaeology of the line. Ingold's argument leads us through the music of Ancient Greece and contemporary Japan, Siberian labyrinths and Roman roads, Chinese calligraphy and the printed alphabet, weaving a path between antiquity and the present. Drawing on a multitude of disciplines including archaeology, classical studies, art history, linguistics, psychology, musicology, philosophy and many others, and including more than seventy illustrations, this book takes us on an exhilarating intellectual journey that will change the way we look at the world and how we go about in it. This Routledge Classics edition includes a new preface by the author.},

  abstract = {Housing affordability is an important policy goal. However, housing is not truly affordable if located in an inaccessible area with high transportation costs. Increasing the supply of affordable housing in accessible locations helps achieve multiple planning objectives: it reduces transportation costs, improves economic opportunity for disadvantaged groups, reduces accident risks, conserves energy and reduces pollution emissions. In recent years researchers have developed analysis methods for measuring total housing and transportation costs for different locations within cities, called a Housing and Transportation (H+T) Affordability Index. This study applies this type of analysis in Qom City, Iran. The results indicate that suburban-area households spend more than 57\% of their monthly income on housing and transport, significantly more than the 45\% spent by households in the central district. This is consistent with research results in other urban areas. This illustrates the feasibility of applying housing and transportation affordability analysis in developing country cities to help identify truly affordable and sustainable development.},

The time consumed in order to travel to a destination has been seen as the price paid for fulfilling the purpose of reaching that destination. By interpreting travel time as a disutility or burden, transport policy has been driven by the goal of quicker journeys. Drawing upon multidisciplinary literature and new qualitative research, this paper articulates an alternative perspective. It suggests that travel time, at least for the individual, can (sometimes) be perceived and experienced as a gift rather than a burden. This is examined in the context of (co-present) participation in social networks and in terms of two forms of travel time experience from which positive utility can be derived: transition time and time out \textendash{} both facilitated or supported by a third notion, namely equipped time.},

  abstract = {Technological innovation and the decreasing costs of wireless and other technologies, combined with progressive policy and regulatory environments, have resulted in the provision of telecommunication services in remote areas thought unserviceable by incumbent telcos in Latin America, Central Europe, and Asia. In line with the increasing number of success stories in other parts of the world, the South African government, as part of the policy of "managed liberalization" of the telecommunications sector, lifted the monopoly provision of telephone services in under-serviced areas by permitting smaller-scale entrants into the telecommunications market.Emerging from the second round of telecommunications policy reform in 2001, following the initial reforms to the sector in 1996, it was anticipated that these special operators would be licensed in 2002. Although licenses were finally granted following several licensing delays in June 2004 to seven applicants (three conditionally) from the ten areas demarcated in the first round, further delays in the final issuing of these licenses meant these licensees were only able to become operational in 2005.With the Ministry of Communications' latest policy directives on further liberalization of the market, which allows for some of the services previously reserved for Under-Serviced Area Licensees (USALs) to be more widely available from February 2005, just prior to the underserviced area licensees coming on stream, the window of opportunity for these small-scale new entrants may have closed.This paper assesses the degree to which policy and regulatory conditions promote the viability of these operators and facilitate their evolution as business and developmental models. Drawing on international experience, the policy and regulatory framework for these licenses is assessed.-super-2 The paper focuses specifically on other jurisdictions where similar regimes have been introduced as part of a national policy rather than on}

The spatial transcript allows researchers to engage in a process of grounded visualisation in order to analyse interview data in the context of the location in which it was gathered.

It tries to answer the following questions: How can environmental impacts of transport be measured? How can measurements be transformed into operational indicators? How can several indicators be jointly considered? And how can indicators be used in planning and decision making? Firstly we provide definition of 'indicator of environmental sustainability in transport'. The functions, strengths and weaknesses of indicators as measurement tools, and as decision support tools are discussed. We define what 'environmental sustainability in transport' may mean through the transport system, the concepts of sustainable development and of environment. The concept of 'chain of causality' between a source and a final target is developed, as a common reference for indicators and assessments. As the decision making context influences the perceived and actual needs for indicators and methods, we also analysed the dimensions and context of decision making. We derived criteria and methods for the assessment and selection of indicators of environmental sustainability in transport, in terms of measurement, monitoring and management. The methods and the criteria are exemplified for seven chains of causality. Methods for a comprehensive joint consideration of environmentally sustainable indicators are analyzed and evaluated. They concerned aggregated or composite indicators as well as multi-criteria methods. Five case studies are presented. Finally, recommendations for continued research and development of indicators and joint considerations methods for assessment of environmental sustainability in transport are given.},

Several extensions are explored, including user-centric and route-centric road map transformations. Our implementation of the algorithm can be applied to any locality where travel time road network data is available. Here, it is illustrated on road network data for a rural region in Ireland. Limitations of the proposed algorithm are examined, and potential solutions are discussed.},

  abstract = {The last three decades have witnessed substantial growth in the literature on excess commuting. Researchers have proposed and applied a number of commuting benchmarks and excess commuting indices that aim to evaluate the commuting efficiency and jobs-housing balance of cities. A comprehensive review and comparative evaluation of the proposed metrics in terms of their ability to capture the intended phenomena, while controlling for the other general characteristics of cities, has yet to be performed. This article attempts to fill this gap by examining four commuting benchmarks (minimum commute, maximum commute, random commute, and proportionally matched commute) and five excess commuting indices (excess commute, commuting potential utilized, commuting economy, normalized commuting economy, and effort). Our conceptual analysis of the indices is complemented with a comparative empirical analysis of commuting in thirty Canadian cities. We explore relationships between the indices and point out the strengths and limitations of each. The findings suggest that no single index can adequately capture the commuting performance of an urban area, while each index can be employed to address a specific policy question. Used together, the indices can provide a reasonably good understanding of urban form and commuting behavior.},

We identified the limitations of quantitative or qualitative surveys and advocate a mixed methods approach to provide an in-depth understanding of travel-based multitasking. We revealed that cross-country comparisons are missing due to the lack of empirical evidence outside the developed countries. While there are indications of increasing multitasking with mobile devices, we found only two longitudinal surveys that provide evidence. We call for a standardisation of definitions of multitasking activities to enable more longitudinal research. We identified 75 variables that were tested for impact on travel-based multitasking in previous research, of which 60 were found to be significant. Sufficient evidence (i.e. minimum three papers), however, only exists for age, gender, trip duration, travel mode, trip purpose, time of the day and day of the week of the trip and the presence of a travel companion. Therefore, more research is suggested to determine the influence of attitude, comfort, availability of equipment, time use and spatial attributes on the type and prevalence of travel-based multitasking},

Multitasking while travelling may fundamentally change the way travel time is valued in the assessment of transport projects and policies. While conventional travel diaries often neglect auxiliary activities during travel, time use research provides a detailed account of activities during each segment of travel. In this paper we present the initial results of the analysis of a large scale time use survey to provide additional empirical evidence for the use of travel time for other activities that might have an impact on how travel time is valued. In addition we consider how a time use survey not specifically designed to capture auxiliary activities while travelling can be applied and adapted for this purpose. Data was collected using the Modular Online Time Use Survey (MOTUS) from the Dutch-speaking population of Flanders, Belgium. 3260 people filled in an online diary for seven days registering all activities including any secondary activities. We found that the proportion of multitasking activities registered is somewhat lower than in previous studies, probably due to underreporting. Our results show that the majority of auxiliary activities are passive (listening to the radio or music). The proportion of `productive' activities (working, studying) is relatively low because they can only be carried out on a public transport vehicle or as a car passenger and the modal share of them is low in the region (6\% and 14\% respectively). We highlight, however, the high frequency of socially relevant activities like having a conversation with a family member or friends. Some recommendations on the further adaptation of time use surveys to register multitasking are also given.},

An activity-based approach is used to generate daily transportation schedules for several groups of households. We first consider the case of mixed traffic, where the bicycles and cars share the same lanes, and find that a significant modal switch to bicycle has indisputable benefits on road congestion and emissions of pollutant gases. We then consider the development of cycle-paths, where the two modes run on separate lanes, and find that it improves the benefits obtained under mixed traffic. At the same time, our analysis shows that a small modal switch (below 15\%) to bicycle does not necessarily produce the expected benefits. This is because in uncongested road sections, the bicycles cause delays to other vehicles.},

  abstract = {This paper is about the role of technology in the transformation of space, and the ways in which these changes are represented. These processes are explored principally through critical analysis of the work of Harvey and Lefebvre; more specifically, I contrast the place of technology as expressed through their varied emphases on the annihilation of space, and the production of space. The dramatic restructuring of space and time in recent decades, associated with new high-speed geographies of production, exchange, and consumption, has been theorized against the backdrop of a 'shrinking world'. The popular conception of the world shrinking to a global village is generally seen as the product of technological advances in telecommunications, transportation, and 'information'. For Harvey, these innovations are seen as the means through which capital has freed itself from spatial constraints. By placing the 'collapse of space' jargon alongside Marx's phrase, the annihilation of space by time, these spatial metaphors serve Harvey as shorthand for the complexities of time - space compression; the shrinking world is seen as a midpoint between a regime of accumulation and a mode of representation. I argue that, although these metaphors help to theorize the relativity of space -- as the global impinges on the local -- they only do so by obfuscating the relative space of everyday life, and the increasingly technical means through which it is produced. Through an interpretation of Lefebvre's discussion of technology in The Production of Space, I suggest how the role of technology in the transformation of space is not limited to those globalizing processes through which the world has been made increasingly interconnected in space and time. So too, technology has been critical to the domination of conceived space over lived space as social relations are spatialized at the scale of experience. As a foundation for these arguments, the social relations of technology and tech nological change are theorized through the incorporation of ideas from the social studies of science and technology and from critical human geography.}

Geographical distance always refer to potential or realized movement between places, and these displacements obey the least effort rule. While this optimization of effort is well known to imply the Triangle Inequality in many situation, breaks in movement generate a paradox: effort optimization, taking into account the need to rest, results in apparent violations of the Triangle Inequality. In order to solve this issue, we introduce contextual metrics that consider space but also any contextual information relevant to travel, such as resources used for moving. Our approach permits to build a subjective space where distances are affected by the characteristics of the individual on the move. Contextual metrics frame the optimization problem in a space enriched by the context that the traveler has to take into account, making apparent that the violation of the Triangle Inequality in case of break was only an artifact of a model lacking crucial information. The range of geographical situations that can be modeled with this framework underline the level of generalization that can be expected from this approach.},

To date, there is a lack of methods and tools to assess to what degree cities currently, or after implementing policies, comply with the X-minute city concept. This research aims to develop a methodology for quantifying the X-minute city through a metric (CSx) that was developed based on an accessibility framework and tested for cycling mode in the Utrecht region in the Netherlands as a study area. Travel data from the Netherlands mobility panel were analysed to determine input characteristics of the metric, such as the weight of destination types. Standardized gravity-based 2-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) accessibility scores for all destination types were weighted and aggregated into a composite metric that shows relative scores as an X-minute city. The results of the analysis show that 100\% of the population in the Utrecht region has access to at least one destination for all 9 destination types within 15~min, whereas this number reduces to 94\% within a 10~min cycling threshold; indicating the status of Utrecht as a cycling city with cycling-friendly infrastructure. Furthermore, low-income groups do not have lower cycling accessibility to the services in the 15~min city in the study area, reinforcing the notion that cycling can be an effective solution to reduce transport inequalities. The developed metric can be used to assess cities on their way towards becoming X-minute city, prioritise neighbourhoods to develop, set quantifiable goals, and evaluate planning scenarios.},

  abstract = {This study makes a contribution to the demography and geography of kinship by studying how internal migration and demography shape the geographical availability of kin in contemporary Sweden. Age structures an individual's relationship with their parents and other kin, and this is reflected in how geographical distance to kin varies over the life course. This study uses a longitudinal approach in which the distance to siblings, parents, and grandparents is measured for the same individuals at different ages. The study follows all men and women in Sweden born in 1970 (N = 74,406) and their kin from age 10 (in 1980) to age 37 (in 2007), examining changes in distances to kin at ages when the cohort leave the parental home and often begin a new family. Swedish administrative registers containing yearly information on residence of everyone in Sweden are used to examine how geographical proximity changes over the life course. The study reveals overall continuity in geographical distance to family members after age 25. Overall, results show that Swedes live close to parents, siblings, and grandparents and have a large family network in their proximity. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper searches for empirical evidence to support this formulation. We show that travellers who indicate that a shorter trip duration is useful or a longer trip duration is very inconvenient have a higher value of travel time. Furthermore, we show that people who can spend their travel time usefully have a lower value of travel time. Finally, the availability of a computer, laptop etc. during the trip increases the probability of travel time being useful. This study determines the sizes of these effects in a case study for The Netherlands. This is important since the value of travel time is likely to change over time. The outcomes of this paper can be used to estimate the size of the expected reduction in value of travel time as a result of future comfort improvements that increase the possibility to work, read a book, watch a movie and communicate during a trip.},

  abstract = {Today's urban design of new quarters in the fringes of German metropolises shows a renaissance of the garage building as a cluster for car parking. In contrast to the past, parking garages are planned as multifunctional ``mobility hubs.'' Planners enrich them with new mobility and sharing options and incorporate sports or social infrastructure facilities on the roof and the ground floor, thus contributing to vibrant neighborhoods. In contrast to the internationally renowned example of Nordhavn (Copenhagen), we observe a decentralization in the mainstreaming of the approach: Mobility hubs are to become constitutive parts of small subcenters. In this respect, they can be seen as a common leitmotiv for urban design in Germany's metropolises. The hubs form a new model of local mobility, guaranteeing a certain flow of pedestrians and freeing the adjacent streets of car traffic. Integrated into a system of alternative modes of transportation and nearby mass transit, those infrastructural and mobility clusters might contribute to a change in mobility habits and ultimately reduce car dependence. If their underlying mobility policies can be implemented and if they are ultimately more successful than traditional parking garages or even create an incentive not to use private cars at all remains open to further investigation. For this purpose, the article will trace the emergence of mobility hubs in the discourse and practice of urban design with a particular focus on major new developments at the periphery of German cities. It analyzes urban design competitions and the formal planning and implementation following them.},

  abstract = {Space-time prisms capture all possible locations of a moving person or object between two known locations and times given the maximum travel velocities in the environment. These known locations or `anchor points' can represent observed locations or mandatory locations because of scheduling constraints. The classic space-time prism as well as more recent analytical and computational versions in planar space and networks assume that these anchor points are perfectly known or fixed. In reality, observations of anchor points can have error, or the scheduling constraints may have some degree of pliability. This article generalizes the concept of anchor points to anchor regions: these are bounded, possibly disconnected, subsets of space-time containing all possible locations for the anchor points, with each location labelled with an anchor probability. We develop two algorithms for calculating network-based space-time prisms based on these probabilistic anchor regions. The first algorithm calculates the envelope of all space-time prisms having an anchor point within a particular anchor region. The second algorithm calculates, for any space-time point, the probability that a space-time prism with given anchor regions contains that particular point. Both algorithms are implemented in Mathematica to visualize travel possibilities in case the anchor points of a space-time prism are uncertain. We also discuss the complexity of the procedures, their use in analysing uncertainty or flexibility in network-based prisms and future research directions.},

These data mainly consist of time-stamped geographical locations, which are collected by location aware devices, such as Global Positioning System receivers. Space\textendash time prisms are used to model the spatio-temporal space of potential movement in between measured locations (called anchors). They rely on the knowledge of the maximal speed of travel of an object and they capture all space\textendash time paths that respect this speed limit. However, the classic space\textendash time path and prism model is not physically realistic, in the sense that it contains spatio-temporal paths of moving objects can alter their direction and speed instantaneously. Since this is physically impossible, the classical model is not acceptable in applications where mechanics and kinetics are vital. We propose a more realistic version of space\textendash time prisms, in which not only speed but also acceleration is bounded. This additional bound results in a physically realistic model, which we refer to as kinetic prisms. Furthermore, we study how imposing constraints on the speed and heading at anchor points affects the geometry of kinetic prisms. In this paper, we give analytical descriptions of kinetic prisms and algorithms for their construction for movement in one- and two-dimensional space.},

  abstract = {Transport and its side effects are major problems in rapidly growing cities. Car traffic dominates these cities and pollutes the environment without being able to sufficiently secure the mobility of the urban population and goods. A paradigm shift in urban and transport policy will be necessary to change this situation. In spite of its different development dynamics, Berlin is an interesting example to discuss development strategies for rapidly growing cities because in the course of more than 100 years, a twofold paradigm shift has occurred in the city both conceptually and practically:~ Berlin has shifted from a city dominated by rail traffic~ to an automobile-oriented city,~ and has then gradually transformed back into a city in which~ an intertwined system of public and non-motorized individual means of transport secures the mobility of the urban population. The interdependencies on the conceptual level between urban planning and transport policies as well as on a practical level between urban structures and transport systems can be studied using the example of Berlin. Experiences with the implementation of automobile-oriented planning and the special conditions in the first decade after reunification led to protests, reflection, and a revision of the transport policy. A strategically designed process of integrated planning has brought about a trend reversal, and steered the development of transport in the direction of clearly formulated sustainability-oriented objectives. In this process, the reintegration of transport and spatial planning and a reorganization of institutional structures at the administrative level was of particular importance. Compact, rail-oriented settlement structures like in the metropolitan region of Berlin make it easier to dispense with automobiles than sprawled structures. The residual role that qualitatively improved automobiles will take in the cities of the future will have to be determined by research and practice. What is certain is that an attractive public transport system should form the backbone of urban transport services.Indicizzazione},

  abstract = {A major difficulty in the analysis of disaggregate activity-travel behavior in the past arises from the many interacting dimensions involved (e.g. location, timing, duration and sequencing of trips and activities). Often, the researcher is forced to decompose activity-travel patterns into their component dimensions and focus only on one or two dimensions at a time, or to treat them as a multidimensional whole using multivariate methods to derive generalized activity-travel patterns. This paper describes several GIS-based three-dimensional (3D) geovisualization methods for dealing with the spatial and temporal dimensions of human activity-travel patterns at the same time while avoiding the interpretative complexity of multivariate pattern generalization or recognition methods. These methods are operationalized using interactive 3D GIS techniques and a travel diary data set collected in the Portland (Oregon) metropolitan region. The study demonstrates several advantages in using these methods. First, significance of the temporal dimension and its interaction with the spatial dimension in structuring the daily space-time trajectories of individuals can be clearly revealed. Second, they are effective tools for the exploratory analysis of activity diary data that can lead to more focused analysis in later stages of a study. They can also help the formulation of more realistic computational or behavioral travel models.},

  abstract = {Transit development is one planning strategy that seeks to partially overcome limitations of low-density single use car oriented development styles. While many studies focus on how residential proximity to transit influences the travel behaviors of individuals, the effect of workplace proximity to transit is less understood. This paper asks, does working near a light rail transit station influence the travel behaviors of workers differently than workers living near a station? We begin by examining workers' commute mode based on their residential and workplace proximity to transit station areas. Next, we analyze the ways in which personal travel behaviors differ between those who drive to work and those who do not. The data came from a 2009 travel behavior survey in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area, which contains 8000 households, 16,000 individuals, and nearly 80,000 trips. We measure sustainable travel behaviors as reduced mileage, reduced number of trips, and increased use of non-car transportation. The results of this study indicate that living near a transit station area by itself does not increase the likelihood of using non-car modes for work commutes. But if the destination (work) is near a transit station area, persons are less likely to drive a car to work. People who both live and work in a transit station area are less likely to use a car and more likely to take non-car modes for both work and non-work (personal) trips. Especially for persons who work near a transit station area, the measures of personal trips and distances show a higher level of mobility for non-car commuters than car commuters \textendash{} that is, more trips and more distant trips. The use of non-car modes for personal trips is most likely to occur by non-car commuters, regardless of their transit station area relationship.},

  abstract = {Sejong Si (Sejong City), the second capital city of South Korea, is a new city initiated to achieve the national policy agenda of balanced territorial development by mitigating the excessive concentration of public and private facilities in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA). The master plan for Sejong City was formulated in 2005 through a project initiated by the Korean government and is noteworthy in that it presents a new urban design paradigm of construction reflecting the Korean experience. This paper explores the characteristics of Sejong City's urban structure and neighborhood design. One major characteristic is Sejong City's ring-shaped design (decentralized and empty in the central area), which makes the city structurally distinct from other modern cities with hierarchical and symbolic structures. Another major characteristic is the presence of approximately 20 neighborhood units located in accordance with the ring-shaped structure. This is consistent with the transit-oriented development (TOD) and traditional neighborhood development (TND) systems. The urban design method based on TOD and TND models has been effective in terms of Sejong City's decentralized urban structure. These results are expected to provide a better understanding of urban design for future development projects.},

Thus, the spatial curve of development, which relates the degree of spatial concentration to the level of transport costs, would be bell-shaped. The paper also provides a detailed discussion of the main determinants of transport costs, which remain fairly large in most countries. It concludes with a discussion of some policy implications.},

  abstract = {Organiser le secteur du transport pour offrir des solutions de d\'eplacement efficaces est aujourd'hui un enjeu capital pour nos soci\'et\'es. La flexibilit\'e, tendant \`a augmenter la qualit\'e de service, constitue un des leviers pour am\'eliorer les transports. Diverses formes de flexibilit\'e apparaissent en effet dans l'offre actuelle. Dans notre th\`ese, nous appr\'ehendons plus particuli\`erement ces services dans deux contextes soci\'etaux distincts : - d'une part, dans un pays industrialis\'e (la France) o\`u le recours aux transports publics reste minoritaire car la d\'ependance \`a l'automobile est toujours tr\`es forte ; - d'autre part, dans un pays en voie de d\'eveloppement (le S\'en\'egal) poss\'edant des moyens financiers limit\'es, mais o\`u l'usage des transports collectifs est g\'en\'eralis\'e, impliquant une grande diversit\'e des modes et une atomisation de l'offre. L'objectif de la th\`ese est d'analyser ces services, les mod\'eliser et les simuler \`a l'aide de Syst\`emes Multi-Agents (SMA) afin d'\'evaluer ce qu'apporte la flexibilit\'e aux transports dans ces deux types de soci\'et\'es. Nous proposons ainsi de confronter le fonctionnement des transports informels et artisanaux s\'en\'egalais (tels que les ' clandos ') avec celui des syst\`emes consid\'er\'es comme plus modernes en France, pour lesquels les capacit\'es d'auto-organisation des individus ont \'et\'e progressivement remplac\'ees par des syst\`emes d'information et de communication de haut niveau technologique et logistique. Ces innovations semblent apporter plus d'imm\'ediatet\'e au transport flexible, mais n\'ecessitent en contrepartie un encadrement fort de la part des autorit\'es publiques g\'en\'erant des contraintes r\'eglementaires et spatiales. \`A l'oppos\'e, les services spontan\'es et d\'er\'egul\'es qui sont propos\'es au S\'en\'egal b\'en\'eficient d'une plus grande souplesse, au d\'etriment de la s\'ecurit\'e des passagers. Les apports et limites des deux types de services de transports sont compar\'es et analys\'es. D'un point de vue m\'ethodologique, notre recherche est bas\'ee sur un ensemble de mod\`eles inspir\'es de syst\`emes de transport observ\'es en France et au S\'en\'egal puis impl\'ement\'es en Syst\`emes Multi- Agents dans l'environnement NetLogo, dont certains sont issus d'une analyse fonctionnelle de terrain et d'autres plus th\'eoriques. Par l'analyse du comportement d'agents r\'ealisant ces services en concurrence et/ou coop\'eration, nous identifions des seuils et des conditions de mise en oeuvre des services en termes d'efficacit\'e et de couverture spatiale. Gr\^ace \`a la confrontation des mod\`eles par la simulation, nous apportons des \'el\'ements de compr\'ehension sur les services auto-organis\'es au S\'en\'egal. Nous montrons \'egalement les forces et les faiblesses des syst\`emes de transport flexibles fran\c{c}ais. Nous proposons enfin des pistes d'int\'egration des services \'etudi\'es dans les syst\`emes de mobilit\'e fran\c{c}ais et s\'en\'egalais.},

Housing is a sphere that carries important social issues. For a human person, housing is the privileged space of domestic life and the intimate setting for the household to which they belong. Housing shelters people and facilitates the basic biological needs, as well as communal living, if the household includes several people. The economic challenge is therefore present, especially since the urban area is larger and more populated. Individual dwellings or collective residences are durable objects that must be planned in order to ensure quality of use, technical robustness and environmental performance in both the construction and use phases.},

  abstract = {This article contributes to the study of "duality" [Breiger, R., 1974. The duality of persons and groups. Social Forces 53, 181-190] in social life. Our study explores multi-level networks of superposed and partially connected interdependencies, the first being inter-organizational, the second inter-individual. We propose a method of structural linked design as an articulation for these levels. First, we examine separately the complete networks at each level. Second, we combine the two networks in relation to one another using systematic information about the membership of each individual in the first network (inter-individual) to one of the organizations in the second network (inter-organizational), as in bipartite networks. This dual positioning, or the linked design approach, is carried out in an empirical study examining performance variations within the "elite" of French cancer researchers in 1999. By looking at measures of centrality, we identify the actors that these top researchers consider as central or peripheral at the inter-individual level (the big and the little fish among the elite), and the laboratories that the research directors consider as central or peripheral at the inter-organizational level (the big and the little ponds among all the laboratories conducting cancer research in France at that time). In addition to the rather trivial report of the competitive advantage of big fish in big ponds (particularly because of the advantage of size for laboratories in this field), we use measurements of scientific performance to identify "catching up" strategies that the smallest fish use in this system. We suggest that this method offers new insights into the duality and multi-level dimension of complex systems of interdependencies, and also into the ways in which actors manage these interdependencies. We believe that it adds a new dimension to the sociological exploration of the determinants of performance, of meso-level phenomena such as opportunity structures and institutional change, or of macro-level phenomena such as social inequalities.},

In fact, most of the footloose relationship-free jobs in apparel and footwear and consumer electronics departed the United States several decades ago, and few U.S. workers today feel the force of Chinese and Indian competition, notwithstanding the alarming anecdotes about the outsourcing of intellectual services. Of course, standardization, mechanization, and computerization all work to increase the number of footloose tasks, but innovation and education work in the opposite direction, creating relationship-based activities\textemdash like the writing of this review.

  abstract = {In order to improve the effectiveness of transit-oriented development (TOD), the integration of public transportation and bikes has been regarded as a good alternative because the catchment area of a station, that is, the spatial extent of TOD, can be increased. This paper suggests the concept of bicycle-based TOD (B-TOD) and estimates the spatial extent, considering the catchment area. For this, a trip survey was conducted among bicycle users who used bicycle and public transportation in Seoul metropolitan and Daejeon metropolitan areas in Korea. Regression and cumulative distribution models were used to estimate the spatial extent of B-TOD. The results show that the estimated access distances were 1.96 km and 2.13 km for origin (home)-to-station and station-to-work trips, respectively, and they can play a yardstick role in the TOD planning practices in Korea. In such cases, the catchment areas of B-TOD cover 73.7\% and 93.6\% of the whole area of Seoul, whereas conventional walking-only TOD can cover only 29.9\% of the same. This implies that B-TOD can help to solve one of the key inherent weaknesses of the conventional TOD. Some limitations and recommendations for future research are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Accessibility is a concept that is not entirely easy to define. Gould (1969) once stated that it is a `slippery notion \ldots{} one of those common terms that everyone uses until faced with the problem of defining and measuring it'. Considerable research over the last 40 years has been devoted to defining and measuring accessibility, ranging from access to jobs within an hour's travel time to the ease at which given places can be reached. This article is concerned with the measurement of access provided by transit. It includes a review of past work on measuring accessibility in general and with respect to transit services in particular. From this overview of the literature, it can be seen that current methods fall short in measuring transit service access in several meaningful aspects. Based on this review and critique, we propose new refinements that can be used to help overcome some of these shortcomings. As a part of this, we define an extended GIS data structure to handle temporal elements of transit service. To demonstrate the value of these new measures, examples are presented with respect to mapping accessibility of transit services in Santa Barbara, California. Finally, we show how these measures can be used to develop a framework for supporting transit service analysis and planning.},

  abstract = {Interest in cities is growing again in Europe. Theories of "growth poles" forgotten since the 1960s re-emerge, although in different form, without the idea of building new cities in the desert. Metropolitanisation, although sometimes difficult to grasp empirically, is recognized as a post-fordist phenomena, with a gain of the importance of large cities, linked to the increasing need for size-based agglomeration effect in the global, networked knowledge economy. And European policy makers are once again discussing the need of and the form for new urban policies at European (as witnessed by the above quote), but also at national scale. From the outset, this project has had two, complementary, but not always easily reconcilable orientations: provide a broad overview of the current and future issues relevant to urban development in all of Europe, advance scientifically beyond the established and well-known data and analyses, provide innovative research. As this report was elaborated in parallel to the new State of European Cities report to be published by DG Regio, we also aimed at complementarity with that report, not wanting to repeat the same analyses based on the same data. In this project, we, therefore, worked in three parallel strands. First, all teams went through the current literature to extract the knowledge about trends, perspectives and, most importantly, driving forces for urban development in their thematic fields. Second, each of the teams focused on one or two innovative empirical research questions, generally tapping new data sources. Finally, our scenario team has taken the work of the other teams, and substantially augmented it through additional literature review, aiming at covering an even larger horizon and to provide a complete knowledge base on urban development, necessary for integrated prospective thinking. On this basis the scenarios were developed. The structure of the report reflects these three strands, adding a fourth, new strand, which consists in an assessment of the current national policy visions on urban issues across Europe. Details of all the literature reviews and analyses are presented in the scientific report.},

A range of capacity effects are addressed: in-vehicle passenger capacity, access-egress capacity in relation to dwelling time, platform occupancy by vehicles which may reduce service frequency. The model treatment involves a line sub-model, which amounts to a sophisticated cost-flow relationship, and platform sub-models first for passenger storage and flowing, second for vehicle operations.

  abstract = {In this engaging and spirited book, eminent social psychologist Robert Levine asks us to explore a dimension of our experience that we take for granted\textemdash our perception of time. When we travel to a different country, or even a different city in the United States, we assume that a certain amount of cultural adjustment will be required, whether it's getting used to new food or negotiating a foreign language, adapting to a different standard of living or another currency. In fact, what contributes most to our sense of disorientation is having to adapt to another culture's sense of time.Levine, who has devoted his career to studying time and the pace of life, takes us on an enchanting tour of time through the ages and around the world. As he recounts his unique experiences with humor and deep insight, we travel with him to Brazil, where to be three hours late is perfectly acceptable, and to Japan, where he finds a sense of the long-term that is unheard of in the West. We visit communities in the United States and find that population size affects the pace of life\textemdash and even the pace of walking. We travel back in time to ancient Greece to examine early clocks and sundials, then move forward through the centuries to the beginnings of ''clock time'' during the Industrial Revolution. We learn that there are places in the world today where people still live according to ''nature time,'' the rhythm of the sun and the seasons, and ''event time,'' the structuring of time around happenings(when you want to make a late appointment in Burundi, you say, ''I'll see you when the cows come in'').Levine raises some fascinating questions. How do we use our time? Are we being ruled by the clock? What is this doing to our cities? To our relationships? To our own bodies and psyches? Are there decisions we have made without conscious choice? Alternative tempos we might prefer? Perhaps, Levine argues, our goal should be to try to live in a ''multitemporal'' society, one in which we learn to move back and forth among nature time, event time, and clock time. In other words, each of us must chart our own geography of time. If we can do that, we will have achieved temporal prosperity.},

  abstract = {Transportation and land use research of the past decade has focused in large part on the question of whether manipulating land uses in the direction of ``smart growth'' alternatives can reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or otherwise improve travel behavior. Yet the notion of ``manipulating'' land uses implies that the alternative is somehow self-organized or market-based. This view appears to underestimate the extent to which current planning interventions in the United States \textendash{} largely focused on lowering development densities, mandating ample road and parking designs, and separating land uses \textendash{} impose an auto-oriented template on most new development. Rather than a market failure, the paucity of ``smart growth'' alternatives may be a planning failure \textendash{} the result of municipal regulatory exclusion. This problem definition would shift the burden of proof for policy reform, as uncertainty in travel-behavior benefits would hardly justify the continuation of exclusionary regulations. If municipal regulations in fact constrain alternatives to low-density, auto-oriented development, one would expect developers to perceive unsatisfied market interest in such development. This article studies, through a national survey (676 respondents), US developers' perceptions of the market for pedestrian-and transit-oriented development forms. Overall, respondents perceive considerable market interest in alternative development forms, but believe that there is inadequate supply of such alternatives relative to market demand. Developer-respondents attribute this gap between supply and demand principally to local government regulation. When asked how the relaxation of these regulations would affect their product, majorities of developers indicated that such liberalization would lead them to develop in a denser and more mixed-use fashion, particularly in close-in suburban locales. Results are interpreted in favor land-policy reform based on the expansion of choice in transportation and land use. This view contrasts with a more prevalent approach which conditions policy interventions on scientific evidence of travel-behavior modification.},

This demonstration (L'Hostis 2016, 2017) reveals key aspects of distances and geographical spaces. We develop this argument by investigating the idea of the optimality of distance through a mathematical and geometric discussion, and by dealing with empirical approaches to applied geography.The first part of the paper explores the consequences of considering that the mathematical property of triangle inequality is always respected. In fact, no violations of triangle inequality are observed in geographical spaces. The study of the optimality of distances in empirical approaches confirms the key role of the property of triangle inequality. The general principle of least-effort applies for most movements and spacings. In addition, however, trajectories with multiple detours, like those of shoppers, runners and nomads, are optimal from a certain point of view. This is also the case for excess travel, i.e. a situation of disjunction between an optimum as perceived by a person in movement and an optimum as perceived by an external observer. Any movement, any spacing within and between cities and in geographical space in general, exhibits a form of optimality, and all geographical distances are optimal.},

  abstract = {From a discussion about the mathematical properties of metrics, we identify three fundamental characteristics of distance, which are optimality, detour and break. We then explore the implications of these properties for transport planning, urbanism and spatial planning. We state that distances contain the idea of optimum and that any distance is associated to a search for optimisation. Pedestrian movements obey this principle and sometimes depart from designed routes. Local sub-optimality conveyed by public transport maps has to be corrected by interventions on public space to relieve the load on central parts of networks. The second principle we state is that detour in distances is most often a means to optimise movement. Fast transport systems generates most of the detour observed in geographical spaces at regional scale. This is why detour has to be taken into account in regional transport policies. The third statement is that breaks in movement contribute to optimising distances. Benches, caf\'es, pieces of art, railway stations are examples of the urban break. These facilities of break represent an urban paradox: they organise the possibility of a break, of a waste of time in a trip, and they also contribute to optimising distances in a wider network. In that sense break should be considered as a relevant principle for the design of urban space in order to support a pedestrian oriented urban form.},

The project will deliver a vision for the European transport system in 2030 and an action plan including a roadmap to implement that vision. The work towards that vision and action plan is based on the identification and assessment of societal challenges that will influence future transport demand and supply and the compilation of a portfolio of promising cross-modal technical and organisational transport solutions. The entire process from studying trends and options for solutions, developing a vision and finally the action plan are organized within a structured participatory approach that focuses on user-centeredness and that aims to engage a broad stakeholder community into the consultation processes. A further goal is to build a European Transport Forum that continues the work beyond the project duration and works on complementing the action plan. The present document reports on the results of researching trends and societal drivers impacting mobility demands and transport in Europe until 2030.},

  abstract = {The success of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) or rail oriented development depends on several factors, among them the characteristics of the public transport system should not be neglected. In the typical tram-train approaches as exemplified in the Karlsruhe experience, a new transport systems is proposed from the association of specific rolling stock, intermediate between tramways and trains, to a combination of urban tram tracks and existing conventional railway system. The adaptation to both central and peripheral contexts, and the promise of relatively low investment costs by reusing the existing infrastructure, explain the interest of such systems in metropolitan contexts. The tram-train approach combines urban considerations with functional characteristics of the transport system in order to provide new benefits in terms of accessibility, as compared to heavier systems.  We propose to examine the project of the conversion of the regional rail Fraisses-Firminy-St-Etienne line into a tram-train corridor. This involves the introduction of a series of new stops that we want to assess: starting from a proposed list of stops, which ones should be introduced? To deal with this issue we have built a multicriteria approach associating transport and urban considerations. The criteria include accessibility measurements, impact of each stop on the total travel time,  catchment areas for population and jobs, existing urban functions in the neighbourhood of the stops, potential for urban development of housing, activities and equipment, potential for connection with other modes, and cost of construction. The multicriteria analysis is able to provide some clear information about the opportunity of introducing each stop. The analysis raises some questions concerning three out of the seven new stops, and provides some relevant informations for the decision processes.},

Dans la litt\'erature du TOD la r\'ef\'erence la plus commun\'ement admise est celle du 1/2 mile qui appara\^it dans la premi\`ere d\'efinition du TOD par Calthorpe (1993). Le quartier \'etant d\'efini comme une aire p\'edestre (pedestrian pocket) Calthorpe se r\'ef\`ere explicitement \`a la marche \`a pied et retient le 1/2 mile comme \'equivalent \`a 10 minutes de marche. Pour Bertolini (Bertolini et Spit 1998) deux approches sont possibles pour d\'efinir les quartiers de gares, soit par l'analyse des dynamiques urbaines, soit par l'analyse de la mobilit\'e. L'analyse de la litt\'erature montre que l'argument de la mobilit\'e est le plus souvent invoqu\'e pour justifier la taille du p\'erim\`etre. Les indications de notre revue bibliographique sont les suivantes : on peut pr\'econiser l'utilisation du 1/2mile, c'est-\`a-dire 800 m\`etres comme r\'ef\'erence pour l'analyse et l'orientation de l'action sur les p\'erim\`etres de gares Une analyse pertinente utilisera un ensemble de rayons concentriques de 400, 800, 1200 m\`etres, etc. : 400 m pour la densit\'e et la mixit\'e urbaine ainsi que sur la facilit\'e de d\'eplacement des pi\'etons 800 m\`etres espace de r\'ef\'erence pour l'analyse TOD avec un accent sur la densit\'e urbaine au-del\`a pour saisir les dynamiques r\'esidentielles et les r\'eseaux p\'edestres, cyclables et transport en commun de rabattement ; la mesure de 2 km pour le v\'elo est not\'ee dans la litt\'erature},

Based on a review of scientific literature, the output of European research projects and reports from consultancies, the result of this investigation provides a broad and comprehensive set of factors that influence, and will influence in the future, mobility and logistics. The set is composed of 29 trends organised under 9 larger categories covering economic issues, societal issues, urbanisation, the environment, the digital society, new business models, safety, security and the legislative framework. The present analysis has greatly benefitted from the concept of liquid modernity developed by Bauman that enabled a broad and complete view on the dynamics of society and mobility. It allows describing linkages between social and economic trends, and between society and technology, especially information and communication technology. Thus, the added value of this contribution is its systematic approach allowing to describe this complex topic in an exhaustive manner while focussing on links and dependencies.},

Apr\`es une p\'eriode interm\'ediaire de recherche de sites et de partenariats locaux le projet Bahn.Ville 2 a \'et\'e men\'e de 2007 \`a 2010 avec le double objectif d'affiner les enseignements de Bahn.Ville 1 et de tester leur mise en \oe uvre sur les terrains de deux r\'egions urbaines : l'une fran\c{c}aise autour de la ligne St-Etienne-Firminy, l'autre allemande focalis\'ee sur la Taunusbahn de la r\'egion de Francfort (Wulfhorst 2007). Le chapitre pr\'esente une synth\`ese des deux projets allemand et fran\c{c}ais pour caract\'eriser un projet d'urbanisme orient\'e vers le rail. Les enjeux de la th\'ematique sont ensuite discut\'es, notamment en lien avec le film de C Lallier sur le sujet et avec les indications issues de la conf\'erence international BUFTOD organis\'ee en 2012.},

  abstract = {Geographical time-spaces exhibit a series of properties, including space inversion, that turns any representation effort into a complex task. In order to improve the legibility of the representation and leveraging the advances of three-dimensional computer graphics, the aim of the study is to propose a new method extending time-space relief cartography introduced by Mathis and L'Hostis. The novelty of the model resides in the use of cones to describing the terrestrial surface instead of graph faces, and in the use of curves instead of broken segments for edges. We implement the model on the Chinese space. The Chinese geographical time-space of reference year 2006 is produced by the combination and the confrontation of the fast air transport system and of the 7.5-times slower road transport system. Slower, short range flights are represented as curved lines above the earth surface with longer length than the geodesic, in order to account for a slower speed. The very steep slope of cones expresses the relative difficulty of crossing terrestrial time-space, as well as the comparably extreme efficiency of long-range flights for moving between cities. Finally, the whole image proposes a coherent representation of the geographical time-space where fast city-to-city transport is combined with slow terrestrial systems that allow one to reach any location.},

Older age ({$>$}40 years), being an agriculturer and poor economic status were significantly associated with longer patient delays. Risk of delay increased with increasing geographical distance, with a greater effect on relatively shorter patient delays. Using the first quartile of distance as the reference group, hazard ratios for subsequent quartiles were 0.61 (0.57\textendash 0.65), 0.30 (0.28\textendash 0.33) and 0.15 (0.14\textendash 0.17) for short patient delays ({$\leq$}60 days), and 1.04 (0.94\textendash 1.17), 0.69 (0.63\textendash 0.77) and 0.43 (0.39\textendash 0.47) for long patient delays ({$>$}60 days).CONCLUSION: Patients living in remote areas need support to overcome the barrier posed by geographical distance, which has a greater effect in the initial phases of the disease.},

  abstract = {Transit Oriented Development as sustainable mobility strategy is not part of French policy, in practice or in academic literature, even though a certain number of projects follow some of its principles. Reciprocally, from abroad, French experiences are not recognized as TOD, even when they could be. Scientific literature is needed in this direction. This is the focus of this paper. This paper identifies two realizations that can be qualified as TOD implementations according to criteria that we have defined previously in a Franco-German research program (Bahn.Ville). For each of these two cases, while their transport network is examined, we also study their insertion into the urban environment at a local level. The interaction between land use and transport system is the focal point of this study through a reading of planning documents, geospatial data specific processing and analysis, and on-site investigations. Parallel analysis is undertaken on the processes of realization. In both cases, we look into cooperation between public and private actors from multiple sectors and on different scales. Combining actual planning strategies, we examine policies of metropolitan level that support similar realizations in the future, not only in the field of transport, but also on housing and economic activities. Therefore, we present existing and future instruments for the implementation of TOD in the Lille Metropolitan Area. New planning tools, such as ``DIVAT'' and ``Contrat d'axe'', are designed in the intent of defining intersectoral policies of transport and urbanism. These tools are currently being introduced and put into practice in Lille Metropolis.},

  abstract = {Geographic analysis has long supported transport plans that are appropriate to local contexts. Many incumbent `tools of the trade' are proprietary and were developed to support growth in motor traffic, limiting their utility for transport planners who have been tasked with twenty-first century objectives such as enabling citizen participation, reducing pollution, and increasing levels of physical activity by getting more people walking and cycling. Geographic techniques\textemdash such as route analysis, network editing, localised impact assessment and interactive map visualisation\textemdash have great potential to support modern transport planning priorities. The aim of this paper is to explore emerging open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning, with reference to the literature and a review of open source tools that are already being used. A key finding is that a growing number of options exist, challenging the current landscape of proprietary tools. These can be classified as command-line interface, graphical user interface or web-based user interface tools and by the framework in which they were implemented, with numerous tools released as R, Python and JavaScript packages, and QGIS plugins. The review found a diverse and rapidly evolving `ecosystem' tools, with 25 tools that were designed for geographic analysis to support transport planning outlined in terms of their popularity and functionality based on online documentation. They ranged in size from single-purpose tools such as the QGIS plugin AwaP to sophisticated stand-alone multi-modal traffic simulation software such as MATSim, SUMO and Veins. Building on their ability to re-use the most effective components from other open source projects, developers of open source transport planning tools can avoid `reinventing the wheel' and focus on innovation, the `gamified' A/B Street https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/\#abstreetsimulation software, based on OpenStreetMap, a case in point. The paper, the source code of which can be found at https://github.com/robinlovelace/open-gat, concludes that, although many of the tools reviewed are still evolving and further research is needed to understand their relative strengths and barriers to uptake, open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning already hold great potential to help generate the strategic visions of change and evidence that is needed by transport planners in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the case that traditional transport appraisal methods do not sufficiently capture the social dimensions of mobility and accessibility. However, understanding this is highly relevant for policymakers to understand the impacts of their transport decisions. These dimensions include the distribution of mobility and accessibility levels over particular areas or for specific population groups, as well as how this may affect various social outcomes, including their levels of participation, social inclusion and community cohesion. In response, we propose a method to assess the socially relevant accessibility impacts (SRAIs) of policies in some of these key dimensions. The method combines the use of underlying ethics principles, more specifically the theories of egalitarianism and sufficientarianism, in combination with accessibility-based analysis and the Lorenz curve and Gini index. We then demonstrate the method in a case study example. Our suggestion is that policymakers can use these ethical perspectives to determine the equity of their policies decisions and to set minimum standards for local transport delivery. This will help them to become more confident in the development and adoption of new decision frameworks that promote accessibility over mobility and which also disaggregate the costs and benefits of transport policies over particular areas or for specific under-served population groups.},

  abstract = {The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a growing interest amongst UK academics and policy makers in the issue of transport disadvantage and, more innovatively, how this might relate to growing concerns about the social exclusion of low income groups and communities. Studies (predominantly in the United Kingdom) began to make more explicit the links policy between poverty, transport disadvantage, access to key services and economic and social exclusion (see for example Church and Frost, 2000; TRaC, 2000; Lucas et al., 2001; Kenyon 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Raje, 2003). By 2003, the UK Social Exclusion Unit had published and its now internationally recognised report on this subject, which subsequently resulted in the development of a set of transport policy guidances to local authorities in England to deliver what is now commonly referred to as accessibility planning as part of their Local Transport Plans (Department for Transport, 2006). Since this time, researchers, policy makers and practitioners in several other countries became interested in adopting a social exclusion approach to transport planning, largely because of its utility in identifying the role of transport, land use planning and service delivery decisions in creating and reinforcing poverty and social disadvantage. Eight years on from the SEU report, we can begin to reflect on the extent to which a social exclusion approach to the research of transport disadvantage has been successful in opening up new avenues of research enquiry and/or identifying new theoretical perspectives and/or methodological approaches. The paper begins by briefly revisiting the basic theories and core definitions which underpin and inform a social exclusion perspective. It then considers how these have been translated and understood in terms of transport. Secondly, it considers some of the emergent empirical research of transport-related exclusion that has attempted to measure and model the interactions between transport and mobility inequalities and relational negative social outcomes. Thirdly, it offers observations on progress in some key areas of policy and practice, with specific reference to the UK and Australia. It concludes by suggesting how further progress might be made on this issue and considers whether the social exclusion agenda is still a relevant approach for achieving this.},

How to choose or define such a distance metric is key, and in this respect, a `Minkowski approach' is proposed that enables the selection of an optimum distance metric for a given GWR model. This approach is evaluated within a simulation experiment consisting of three scenarios. The results are twofold: (1) a well-chosen distance metric can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of a GWR model; and (2) the approach allows a good approximation of the underlying `optimal distance metric', which is considered useful when the `true' distance metric is unknown.},

  abstract = {In the face of a society that exhibits an increasing dependence on motorised mobility, the response of transport policy is one that remains grounded in the pursuit of quicker journey times. Less time spent travelling is assumed to convert `unproductive' time into economically valuable time. This paper explores an alternative perspective on travel time. It seeks to examine the notion that travel time, rather than being wasted, can and does possess a positive utility. This brings into question the extent of assumed economic benefits derived from schemes and policies intended to reduce journey times. Specifically the paper reports on a national mail-back questionnaire survey of 26,221 rail passengers in Great Britain conducted in autumn 2004. The survey examined how passengers used their time on the train, how worthwhile that time use was considered to be and the role of mobile technologies. The results paint a picture of travel time use in which the behaviour and opinions of commuters, business travellers and leisure travellers are compared and contrasted. A substantial if not overwhelming incidence of positive utility of travel time use is revealed, especially for business travel but also for commuting and leisure travel. In light of the survey evidence the paper points to the challenge of understanding the notion of productivity and offers some critical comments concerning the current approach to economic appraisal in Britain.},

My aim in this paper is to explore the nature and role of public space and its significance for cities today. I look at how the promotion of public space is, on the one hand, a concern for social and functional integration in response to social and spatial segregation of cities and the privatization of public space and, on the other hand, a vehicle of marketing localities and consuming places, all leading to multiple representations and meanings. I argue that it is important that the development of urban public space, as part of a larger, often despatialized public sphere, addresses these tensions and contributes to the emergence of an urbanism which promotes social integration and tolerance.},

  abstract = {The concept of competitiveness has grown significantly and it is now common for cities, regions and nations to assess, improve and publicise their competitive standing vis-\`a-vis other places. Yet it remains rather unclear just what competitiveness is when applied to places, which have objectives distinct from those of private-sector organisations, for whom share price and profitability serve as common metrics. The blurring of the responsibilities of the public and private sectors also complicates matters, with the former making increasing use of the terminology and priorities of business. This paper takes the view that both public and private sectors-and their interactions\textemdash are sustained by networks. To be effective, these networks must operate at the global, national, regional and local scales, gathering knowledge via social interaction\textemdash that is, through 'soft' networks. To a growing degree, competitive networking also demands technological capability, whether in high-tech sectors, `smokestack' industries or public-sector organisations. This capability now demands 'hard' networks that 'plug into' the Internet. Decisions about the location of this infrastructure are largely in the hands of the private sector, responding to agglomeration economies and other `imperatives' of the business world. The Internet also has created a new set of imperatives regarding information flow, since any competitive organisation must have an informative and 'user-friendly' website. Such new demands continue to 'raise the bar' regarding what urban competitiveness means.},

  abstract = {From early studies of time allocation onward, it has been acknowledged that the ``productive'' nature of travel could affect its utility. Currently, at the margin an individual may choose transit over a shorter automobile trip, if thereby she is able to use the travel time more productively. On the other hand, recent advancements toward partly/fully automated vehicles are poised to revolutionize the perception and utilization of travel time in cars, and are further blurring the role of travel as a crisp transition between location-based activities. To quantify these effects, we created and administered a survey to measure travel multitasking attitudes and behaviors, together with general attitudes, mode-specific perceptions, and standard socioeconomic traits (N\,=\,2229 Northern California commuters). In this paper, we present a revealed preference mode choice model that accounts for the impact of multitasking attitudes and behavior on the utility of various alternatives. We find that the propensity to engage in productive activities on the commute, operationalized as using a laptop/tablet, significantly influences utility and accounts for a small but non-trivial portion of the current mode shares. For example, the model estimates that commuter rail, transit, and car/vanpool shares would respectively be 0.11, 0.23, and 1.18 percentage points lower, and the drive-alone share 1.49 percentage points higher, if the option to use a laptop or tablet while commuting were not available. Conversely, in a hypothetical autonomous vehicles scenario, where the car would allow a high level of engagement in productive activities, the drive-alone share would increase by 1.48 percentage points. The results empirically demonstrate the potential of a multitasking propensity to reduce the disutility of travel time. Further, the methodology can be generalized to account for other properties of autonomous vehicles, among other applications.},

  abstract = {Daily activities and mobility dynamics play a central role in the spread of COVID-19. Close physical interactions involved by certain daily activities help transmit the virus. Travel required by the spatial distribution of activities contributes to the propagation of the virus. In order to control and limit this propagation, it is critical to understand the contribution of daily activities to the dynamics of COVID-19. This paper investigates the connection between daily activities, their distribution in space and time, the characteristics of the individuals performing them, and the transmission of the virus. A business-as-usual agent-based simulation scenario of Montreal, Canada is used. To address this research question, we use two agent-based models: MATSIM and EPISIM. MATSIM simulates daily activities and mobility dynamics of the population. EPISIM simulates the spread of the virus in the population using contact networks computed by MATSIM. A synthetic population of Montreal is defined to replicate the main observed sociodemographic characteristics of Montrealers as well as their activity and mobility patterns. The definition of the synthetic population relies on various data sources: household travel survey, census, real estate, car ownership, and housing data. In the business-as-usual scenario, findings underline the significant role of home, work, and school activities in community transmission of COVID-19. Secondary activities, including leisure and shopping, also help spread the virus, but to a lesser degree in comparison with primary activities. The risk of infection in the workplace depends on the economic sector. Healthcare workers are, by far, the most exposed workers to the virus. Workplace infections mirror the gender-biased job market of Montreal. Most infections in the healthcare and educational services are among women. Most infections in the manufacturing, construction, transportation, and warehousing industries are among men. In the business-as-usual scenario where community transmission is high, primary and secondary school-aged children are found to be a major transmission vector of the virus. Finally, simulation results suggest that the risk of infection in the public transportation system is low.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has rampaged through the world causing hundreds of thousands of fatalities, millions of infections, and acute economic and social consequences. In this context, epidemiological models have been put forward as key tools to help public health authorities and policy makers cope with the pandemic. In some cases, these models have proved to be useful aid-decision tools. Nonetheless, in several instances, these models still face several shortcomings and challenges. First, most popular epidemic models still rely on an aggregate representation of the population. Second, the reliability and accuracy of these models in the presence of biased input data is yet to be tested. In this research, we address these two challenges by conducting a sensitivity analysis on the impact of bias in input data, using a transportation agent-based model (MATSIM), and a MATSIM-dependent epidemic model, EPISIM. Our findings stress that epidemic predictions are sensitive towards bias in input data. The underestimation of confirmed infections and the overestimation of the rate of fatalities in official public health reports, bias modeling outcomes. We found that when such biased data are used to train EPISIM, predictions of severe cases and infections are often overestimated. This overestimation bias conveys a false picture of the dynamics of the pandemic. The policy implications of these findings are of interest to both researchers and policy makers.},

The NATO ASI marked a stage in a two-year research project at the U. S. National Center for Geographic Infonnation and Analysis (NCOIA). In 1987, the U. S. National Science Foundation issued a solicitation for proposals to establish the NCGIA-and one element of that solicitation was a call for research on a "fundamental theory of spatial relations". We felt that such a fundamental theory could be searched for in mathematics (geometry, topology) or in cognitive science, but that a simultaneous search in these two seemingly disparate research areas might produce novel results. Thus, as part of the NCGIA proposal from a consortium consisting of the University of California at Santa Barbara, the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the University of Maine, we proposed that the second major Research Initiative (two year, multidisciplinary research project) of the NCOIA would address these issues, and would be called "Languages of Spatial Relations" The grant to establish the NCOIA was awarded to our consortium late in 1988.},

In probing the conditions under which some manage to remain ``sticky'' places in ``slippery'' space, this paper rejects the ``new industrial district,'' in either its Marshallian or more recent Italianate form, as the dominant paradigmatic solution. I identify three additional types of industrial districts, with quite disparate firm configurations, internal versus external orientations, and governance structures: a hub-and-spoke industrial district, revolving around one or more dominant, externally oriented firms; a satellite platform, an assemblage of unconnected branch plants embedded in external organization links; and the state-anchored district, focused on one or more public-sector institutions. The strengths and weaknesses of each are reviewed. The hub-and-spoke and satellite platform variants are argued to be more prominent in the United States than the other two. The findings suggest that the study of industrial districts requires a broader institutional approach and must encompass embeddedness across district boundaries. The research results suggest that a purely locally targeted development strategy will fail to achieve its goals.},

This paper discusses the use of bike-and-ride in three countries with widely differing bicycle cultures and infrastructures: the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. The share of the bicycle in access trips is comparable to general levels of bicycle ridership in each country, but only for train services and other fast modes of public transport. Strong similarities are found in the characteristics of bike-and-ride trips and users, in terms of travel distances, travel motives, and the impact of car availability. The majority of bike-and-ride users travels between 2 and 5 km to a public transport stop, with longer access distances reported for faster modes of public transport. Work and education are the main travel motives, with the first dominating the faster modes and the second the slower modes of public transport. Car availability hardly influences the choice for a combined use of bicycle and train, but strongly affects the levels of bike-and-ride for slower modes of transport.},

This paper discusses the experiences with, and impacts of, such initiatives in the Netherlands. The Dutch measures to promote bicycle use in access trips have been generally successful. A country-wide program to upgrade regular and secure bicycle parking at train stations has led to an increase in user satisfaction and a growth in bicycles parked at stations. Smaller programs to stimulate the combined use of bike-and-bus have resulted in an increase in bicycle use, bus use, and share of infrequent bus passengers. Bicycle lockers at bus stops are hardly used by bus passengers, due in part to the dominance of students among bus users as well as the relatively high price of lockers in comparison to the value of bicycles used for access trips. Measures to promote the use of the bicycle in egress trips have met with more varying results. Projects to introduce leasing bicycles for egress trips have failed to attract passengers, for both train and bus services. In contrast, the introduction of flexible rental bicycles at train stations has resulted in a small reduction in car use, growth in train trips, and growth in bicycle use for non-recurrent trips. The Dutch experiences suggest some lessons for promoting bike-and-ride in countries and cities with a less well-developed bicycle infrastructure.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission impacts that result from individuals participating in carsharing organizations within North America. The authors conducted an online survey with members of major carsharing organizations and evaluated the change in annual household emissions (e.g., impact) of respondents that joined carsharing. The results show that a majority of households joining carsharing are increasing their emissions by gaining access to automobiles. However, individually, these increases are small. In contrast, the remaining households are decreasing their emissions by shedding vehicles and driving less. The collective emission reductions outweigh the collective emission increases, which implies that carsharing reduces GHG emissions as a whole. The results are reported in the form of an observed impact, which strictly evaluates the changes in emissions that physically occur, and a full impact, which also considers emissions that would have happened but were avoided due to carsharing. The mean observed impact is {$<$}formula formulatype="inline"{$><$}tex Notation="TeX"{$>\$$}-\${$<$}/tex{$><$}/formula{$>$}0.58 t GHG/year per household, whereas the mean full impact is {$<$}formula formulatype="inline"{$><$}tex Notation="TeX"{$>\$$}-\${$<$}/tex{$><$}/formula{$>$}0.84 t GHG/year per household. Both means are statistically significant. We present a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the results and find that the overall results hold across a variety of assumptions. The average observed vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) per year was found to decline by 27\%. We conclude with an evaluation of the annual aggregate impacts of carsharing based on current knowledge of the industry membership population.}

  abstract = {Le document est compos\'e de quatre parties. La premi\`ere relate le parcours personnel de recherche, sur le plan institutionnel et sur celui des th\`emes abord\'es et des travaux effectu\'es. Cependant, plus important que cette simple pr\'esentation, est l'expos\'e du parcours intellectuel en montrant tout d'abord l'importance de la compl\'ementarit\'e entre une recherche en am\'enagement-urbanisme et une recherche sur l'am\'enagement-urbanisme. Cela permet par la suite d'approfondir la notion d'interdisciplinarit\'e en am\'enagement-urbanisme. Alors qu'elle est g\'en\'eralement seulement \'evoqu\'ee ou invoqu\'ee, elle nous appara\^it comme devant \^etre raisonn\'ee, large et critique. De m\^eme, nous expliciterons le parcours m\'ethodologique qui a consist\'e \`a partir du choix d'une conception de l'am\'enagement-urbanisme comme \'etant essentiellement technique pour arriver ensuite \`a une conception plus politique de cette pratique.  La deuxi\`eme partie entre dans le vif du sujet des valeurs en am\'enagement-urbanisme, en clarifiant la probl\'ematique, en fournissant les d\'efinitions n\'ecessaires ainsi que les diff\'erents courants de l'am\'enagement-urbanisme pour montrer la plurivocit\'e des termes utilis\'es. Au-del\`a de la terminologie, ces courants reposent sur des fondements id\'eologiques diff\'erents et la situation actuelle appara\^it comme un mixte entre ces diff\'erents courants et des pratiques qui ne r\'ef\`erent \`a aucun d'entre eux. Un certain pragmatisme ne permet plus au concepteur et/ou au d\'ecideur de mouler son projet dans l'id\'eologie contenue dans les textes d'un th\'eoricien ou dans un courant, quels qu'ils soient. Etre am\'enageur-urbaniste, c'est \^etre l'utilisateur d'un certain nombre de pratiques, de savoir-faire et de connaissances, mais aussi le vecteur de croyances, plus ou moins fond\'ees, plus ou moins vraies mais absolument n\'ecessaires pour travailler l'espace, concevoir un projet, r\'epondre \`a une commande. Cet ensemble de croyances qui incluent des valeurs am\`ene la question d'un \'eventuel d\'eterminisme des valeurs chez l'am\'enageur-urbaniste, d\'eterminisme non absolu. Avant d'analyser certaines d'entre elles, il est n\'ecessaire de faire un d\'etour concernant l'apparition des valeurs, non en tant que telles, mais en tant que question : qu'est-ce qui fait que, actuellement, les valeurs, qui ont toujours exist\'e, posent question ? La disparition progressive ou la relativisation du paradigme rationaliste, expos\'e en g\'en\'eral et dans ses applications \`a l'am\'enagement-urbanisme, fournit un \'el\'ement d'explication de l'apparition de nouvelles formes de pratiques qui mettent en avant d'autres valeurs que celles qui tournent autour des notions de rationalit\'e, de d\'eduction, de coh\'erence. Ainsi, une double approche th\'eorique et historique de l'am\'enagement-urbanisme, comme pratique identifiable dans l'histoire et comme mise en \oe uvre d'un paradigme puis des cons\'equences de la relativisation de celui-ci, est men\'ee. Les valeurs qui nous paraissent les plus mobilis\'ees dans la pratique de l'am\'enageur-urbaniste fonctionnent comme des couples fin-moyen : l'\'equit\'e comme mise en \oe uvre sur le plan spatial, par la transformation de l'espace, de la justice sociale forme, avec celle-ci, le premier couple. Le second est celui compos\'e de la mixit\'e et de la solidarit\'e. La premi\`ere permet-elle la seconde ? De quelle mani\`ere ? La r\'ef\'erence \`a la loi relative \`a la Solidarit\'e et au Renouvellement Urbains est \'evidente et in\'evitable. Le troisi\`eme couple lie coh\'erence spatiale et coh\'esion sociale. Quelles sont les relations entre ces deux notions ? Laquelle d\'etermine l'autre ? Enfin, une valeur permet de donner une certaine coh\'erence \`a ces trois couples dont les contradictions internes sont mises en \'evidence. Il s'agit de l'int\'er\^et g\'en\'eral. On peut, lui aussi, l'analyser dans un couple, non de type fin/moyen, mais d'opposition entre int\'er\^et particulier et int\'er\^et g\'en\'eral. Cependant, il sera plut\^ot analys\'e en termes de mise en coh\'erence, \'eventuellement arbitraire, entre les couples pr\'ec\'edents.},

Le trafic routier, les communaut\'es de quartier, les transactions marchandes ou relationnelles, les pollutions, les V\'elib' disponibles, chaque \'ev\'enement est une information qui circule instantan\'ement \`a travers les r\'eseaux de la ville. Cet \'echange instantan\'e de donn\'ees entre la ville 2.0 et ses usagers forment une sorte de r\'eseau peer-to-peer. Cela permet de nouvelles formes de r\'egulations de la ville : surveillance des pollutions, nouvelles pratiques sociales et \'economiques, cogestion de la mobilit\'e, etc. Alors, quelque chose de nouveau appara\^it, quelque chose qui va bouleverser notre rapport au territoire. Un nouveau m\'edia est n\'e et va modifier radicalement notre vie urbaine et la fa\c{c}on de gouverner la ville : c'est le 5e \'ecran. Le citadin lambda devient un m\'edia, un producteur d'information, et les prestataires de la ville (transport, afficheurs, services publics, etc.) deviennent les fournisseurs de nouveaux services urbains. Ce livre propose d'en comprendre toutes les implications et analyse comment cela va changer notre vie quotidienne dans la ville 2.0.},

There are 5 sets of goals (basic needs) which are related to each other and are arranged in a hierarchy of prepotency. When the most prepotent goal is realized, the next higher need emerges. "Thus man is a perpetually wanting animal." Thwarting, actual or imminent, of these basic needs provides a psychological threat that leads to psychopathy.

  abstract = {Evaluation of spatial accessibility to public transportation has a weak background in many emerging countries, including Iran. Transit-Oriented Development is of great interest among Iranian planners and academics, but little is known about transit orientation provided by major public transport systems exemplified by the Tehran Metro. Statistical difference tests and polynomial regression done in this study show how residential densities within walking distances of metro stations established at different times after 1998 are significantly different. Both population and employment densities have decreased in more recent stations compared to those opened between 2005 and 2010. Moreover, one-way T-Tests comparing the population and densities of older lines with those of newer lines reveal that, in most cases, densities within walking distances of stations of older lines are higher. The paper concludes that lack of proper site selection and failing to locate new stations near job centers and highly populated areas threatens the transit-friendliness that emerged in the early years after establishing the first metro station in 1998.},

It argues that one of the things holding physical and human geography apart for so long has been their relationship to physics as an assumed model of `science'. It is proposed here that not only is this an inadequate model of science but that it has led us astray in our inherited conceptualizations of both time and space. The urge to think `historically' is now evident in both physical and human geography. The paper argues that this both forms the basis for a possible conversation and also obliges us to rethink our notions of space/space-time.},

  abstract = {A broad consensus exists across Europe that coordination is needed between public transport and urban planning in order to achieve sustainable cities. However, there remains a wide gap between planning theory and actual local practice. In response to these difficulties, a new `bottom-up' tool has recently been developed in France by a number of local government bodies: the contrat d'axe (CDA). This paper analyses how this new instrument of public policy is used locally in the case of regional railway transport projects. Including an examination of the processes of decision-making and institutional cooperation between stakeholders and based on a comparative analysis of three pioneering regional railway CDAs, this article highlights the strengths and limitations of CDAs in coordinating land-use and transport development.},

Elle dessine ainsi un chapelet de quartiers mixtes et conviviaux autour d'un grand creux de verdure. Puis elle peut cro\^itre sans perdre ses atouts en ajoutant de nouvelles boucles. Le chiffrage de ses formes et flux r\'ev\`ele les qualit\'es \'etonnantes li\'ees \`a ses trois principes : densit\'es contrast\'ees, g\'en\'ereuses et attractives ; proximit\'es favorables \`a la marche et au v\'elo ; circulations motoris\'ees des biens et des personnes consommant tr\`es peu d'\'energie, d'espace et de revenus... Pour garantir \`a tous un acc\`es " durable " \`a tous les lieux fr\'equent\'es d'une " vraie " ville ; pour assainir son march\'e foncier et celui de l'emploi ; et bien d'autres bonnes choses ! Parce qu'elle se g\`ere avec facilit\'e, qu'elle cro\^it en prenant soin du milieu naturel et qu'elle " enrichit chacun de ce dont il n'a plus besoin quand il l'habite ", la ville creuse peut se voir comme la composante mat\'erielle d'une ville " durable " ou " soutenable ". Nuls verrous techniques ou \'economiques. Sa faisabilit\'e suppose surtout une gestion coh\'erente et globale des sols, que pourraient induire en partie l'outil fiscal et la conception sobre des infrastructures qui les valorisent. Solution ouverte sur bien des th\`emes, la ville creuse voudrait nous laisser un sentiment de libert\'e et d'espoir face \`a l'amoncellement d\'eprimant des d\'efis majeurs, locaux ou globaux. Elle nous invite \`a inventer, \`a dessiner, \`a nous organiser aux bonnes \'echelles... Afin qu'il soit toujours possible de nous trouver " un creux o\`u installer nos vies ".

  abstract = {Urban intensification as part of a smart growth strategy can facilitate low-energy transport modes and reduce overall car use, with benefits to the global environment, but evidence suggests the effect will be less than proportional. Hence, in locations where intensification occurs, greater concentrations of traffic tend to occur, and this worsens local environmental conditions. This phenomenon is defined below as the `paradox of intensification'. The consequent challenges for planners and policymakers, which arise, are considered. The analysis suggests that a compromise involving limited intensification would merely redistribute the balance between the two sets of problems: global and local. It is concluded that urban intensification should be accompanied by more radical measures to constrain traffic generation within intensified areas.},

  abstract = {In this paper I challenge the obsession of many Anglophone human geographers with time-space and space-time. While acknowledging that spacing and timing are important dimensions of the unfolding of many events, I question the logic of positioning them as the primordial, foundational, a priori measures for thinking about events, position, extension and context, and I suggest that their prioritisation reflects the continuing power of space and time as concepts in both classical and modern science and significant strands of philosophy. The paper traces how space and time have increasingly been thought together by human geographers since the late 1960s, examining how discussions of time-space and space-time have underpinned the writings of thinkers such as Torsten H\"agerstrand, Nigel Thrift, Anthony Giddens, David Harvey and Doreen Massey. The paper draws upon strands of processual, poststructuralist and post-phenomenological thinking in an attempt to map out a different way of thinking about the unfolding of events, in which spacing and timing should not be seen a priori to be any more important than other constitutive measures \textendash{} e.g. movement, rhythm, force, energy, affect or sensation \textendash{} in the unfolding and turbulence of the world. The paper then describes how certain practices like driving and dancing may be characterised by an apprehension and inhabitation of movement-space rather than space-time.},

We assume that an acceptable travel time is defined through utilitarian processes that are related to cognitive and affective evaluations of travel that develop throughout a person's lifetime. We apply a mixed methods approach to explore our hypothesis, based on semi-structured in-depth interviews with a stratified, according to commuting mode, random sample of 20 individuals living in Berkeley, CA. Our results support the validity of the acceptable travel time concept and offer (a) initial evidence on its variation to the travel mode and sociodemographic characteristics and (b) insights into people's perceptions, attitudes, feelings and experiences about their travel. Thus, our results can contribute to a better understanding of individuals' travel decisions and valuation of travel time and can inform time\textendash space and accessibility research.},

  abstract = {Classic time geography is powerful but rigid, admitting only uniform travel velocities. Computational time geographic methods that resolve the uniform velocity assumption through transportation networks or isochrones only partially address this weakness and do not have a rigorous theoretical foundation. This article develops an analytical time geographic theory for the case where travel velocities vary continuously across space. Using the continuous transportation or ``urban fields'' tradition in quantitative geography and regional science, this article formulates analytical definitions of the space\textendash time path and prism for the case where unobserved components are characterized by minimum cost curves through an inverse velocity field rather than straight line segments through a uniform velocity plane. This provides a geometrically and visually oriented approach to capturing complex velocities that complements existing methods. Time geographic fields also generalize time geography as the classic and isochrone versions are special cases; these now have a rigorous analytical foundation. It also can extend the network approach by treating links as regions with continuously varying velocities. Time geographic fields are also useful for nonnetwork-constrained phenomena such as movement through terrain, water, and air. This article illustrates the approach using a computational implementation based on a lattice approximation.},

However, the increasing mobility and connectivity of many people in the world means that the relationships between people and place are becoming more subtle and complex, rendering a place-based perspective incomplete. This article discusses the need to move beyond a place-based perspective in geographic information science to include a people-based perspective (i.e., the individual in space and time). It reviews the theories and technologies that can support the people-based perspective and provides some example applications of the people-based perspective.}

Ind\'ependamment des choix et des motivations individuelles, ces comportements peuvent \^etre influenc\'es par les caract\'eristiques de l'environnement urbain. Les mobilit\'es actives, repr\'esent\'ees par la marche et le v\'elo, sont peu \'etudi\'ees en tant que comportements de sant\'e alors que l'activit\'e physique est l'un des d\'eterminants des principales pathologies chroniques (maladies cardio-vasculaires, diab\`ete, ob\'esit\'e, certains cancers). Promouvoir les mobilit\'es actives (la marche et le v\'elo) appara\^it aujourd'hui comme une priorit\'e de sant\'e publique. L'un des enjeux de recherche dans ce domaine est de mieux mesurer ces mobilit\'es actives, dans un contexte de \guillemotleft ~vie r\'eelle~\guillemotright, et de mieux identifier leurs lieux de pratique. Dans ce cadre, cet article pr\'esente une m\'ethode de recueil et de traitement des donn\'ees bas\'ee sur la combinaison de capteurs de mouvements (GPS et acc\'el\'erom\`etre) et l'impl\'ementation des donn\'ees recueillies dans un syst\`eme d'information g\'eographique.

In Experiment 1, the six directions between sets of threetriad locations in a town were judged from memory. The angle formed by the two judged directions from a location to the other two locations in a triad was derived. The three derived angles of a triad were then summed. The derived angles were found to be biased toward 90 deg. The sum of the three derived angles of a triad also exceeded 180 deg, which violates the euclidean properties of real maps. In Experiment 2, subjects judged the direction between pairs of American cities in both directions. The judged directions were found to be consistently nonreversible, which is contrary to the properties of euclidean geometry. The study suggests that information judged from cognitive maps can contain internally inconsistent spatial properties, and the results are discussed in terms of current theories of spatial representation.},

This paper examines intermodal trips involving private (e-)scooters and trains with the objective to investigate the influence of this intermodal combination on station catchment areas. The methodology is based on the analysis of existing scientific research and empirical evidences. The case study focuses on access data from 12 railway stations collected by SNCF R\'eseau in the Provence-Alpes-C\^ote d'Azur region in September and October 2020. Main findings of this secondary analysis, based on 53 passengers using this personal device, suggest an over-representation of male and younger users, with very frequent intermodal practices mainly dedicated to work or study, and a feeder distance between combined walking and cycling. There appears to be similarities between bike-and-ride and scoot-and-ride but also clear distinctions that characterize this emerging mode, among which the fact that scooter is almost always used both during access and egress stages. This article advocates that station areas should be better considered by redesigning the surrounding public spaces to better balance the space of each mode, in favour of alternatives to the car and sustainable cities.},

As the potential list of information aspects that can be included in such systems is long, it is interesting to examine the relative importance of different information aspects. This study reports the relative importance travelers attach to a range of information aspects. In addition, the willingness to pay for this information was examined by conducting a stated choice experiment, in which price was traded off against groupings of information aspects. The results of the study indicate that even though public transport travel information is highly price sensitive, travelers are willing to pay for it if the information systems provide additional functionality such as real-time information and, to a lesser extent, additional trip planning options.},

The concept, offering a novel perspective of \&ldquo;chrono-urbanism\&rdquo;, adds to existing thematic of Smart Cities and the rhetoric of building more humane urban fabrics, outlined by Christopher Alexander, and that of building safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities, as depicted in the Sustainable Development Goal 11 of the United Nations. With the concept gaining ground in popular media and its subsequent adoption at policy level in a number of cities of varying scale and geographies, the present paper sets forth to introduce the concept, its origins, intent and future directions.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the built environment and travel satisfaction has not been adequately explored in previous research. This study examines how urban form affects travel satisfaction using survey and interview data from Oslo metropolitan area, which is a good case for such a study since compact and sprawled urban forms are found to a large extent in the same city region. Results suggest that commute satisfaction as well as leisure travel satisfaction are significantly higher for residents of compact urban neighborhoods than those of sprawled suburbs. The article further focuses on commute satisfaction and finds that this difference is mainly due to differences in (a) trip duration and (b) travel modal split between the two urban form types. (a) Shorter distances to the city center and higher neighborhood densities are associated with significantly lower trip duration to work or education. This lower trip duration experienced by compact-city residents significantly contributes to their higher travel satisfaction. (b) Significant differences in the impact of travel mode on travel satisfaction, controlling for trip duration, are found. From most to least pleasant, travel modes are evaluated as follows: (1) walk, (2) bike and train, (3) bus, tram and metro, and (4) car. These differences contribute to the higher travel satisfaction found in compact neighborhoods, since residents of compact neighborhoods use active travel modes (walking and cycling) to a high extent and the car to a low extent, while suburban residents walk and cycle significantly less and use the car significantly more. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that compact-city policies and car restrictions that are currently applied or planned to be applied in several cities worldwide can have a positive impact on travel satisfaction as they lead to shorter trip durations and more active travel compared with urban sprawl policies.},

The large development of the network multiplies the possibilities of travelling for commuting. However, not only the feasibility but also the characteristics of the trip, in terms of ticket cost and time spent on the travel, become essential factors when considering HSR commuting links. This paper presents a person-based methodology focused on travellers' needs and working schedules constraints, which allow differentiating among connections and identifying those intervals of time spent and costs that are affordable for commuting.},

  abstract = {High-speed rail (HSR) was originally conceived to connect large metropolitan areas in competition with air transport and suitable for distances between 400~km and 600~km. Since the opening of the first HSR, several studies have been undertaken to evaluate the increased accessibility HSR provides. The accessibility indicators used in these assessments consider the characteristics of the new transport system (speed, layout, stops, etc.) that are fundamentally related to the infrastructure itself. However, many studies on HSR have also highlighted the importance of providing services (timetables, frequencies, and fares). A high-performance infrastructure such as HSR may not reach its full potential in terms of accessibility and reducing travel times unless adequate services are provided. Considering this service approach, the paper presents a comparative accessibility analysis of the Spanish high-speed rail network based on two indicators: one focused on the potential connectivity between stations (location-based measure) and the other based on actual HSR services (schedule-based measure). This latter calculation has been established taking into account the available time at the destination and the associated travel costs. The use of this measure to assess the accessibility of the Spanish HSR network provides a new perspective on the real usefulness of this infrastructure. Comparing these two measures helps us evaluate the extent to which the services provided in each city allow the HSR network to reach its full potential accessibility. The comparison also highlights many dissimilarities among cities. This method provides a useful tool for transport planning and improving city design strategies.},

It is generally agreed that these dimensions are problematic and could seriously distort understanding of migration, but data constraints have effectively obstructed further insights. This article focuses on the spatial dimension where migration is typically defined as movement across administrative borders. Borders usually serve as proxies for migration distance but the validity of such proxies is largely unknown, posing a considerable challenge to migration research. Using data for all internal migrants in Sweden, the only known country where migration distances are available in sufficient detail, we present the first accurate description of actual migration distances and investigate the relationship between actual migration distances and migration-defining boundaries. More specifically, we examine how the volumes of migration and the characteristics of migrants change when migration distances vary and when different types of migration-defining boundaries are employed. The findings show that notable shares of short-distance migrants are included almost regardless of which migration-defining boundary is employed, but migrant differentials are less affected than might be expected.},

They enhance a city's economic efficiency, quality of life, and image through their traditional role as provider of local mobility between home, work, and leisure, as well as their new role in supporting global mobility between airports, business districts, and other critical economic nodes as a strategy to attract highly mobile high-human-capital individuals, investment, and tourists. Using a database of 140 urban rail transit systems at five intervals since 1970, we rank cities using an index that tracks each system's level of population exposure as well as its provision of airport access. We find that (1) higher ranked producer service cities provide better quality local and global mobility; (2) investment in urban rail has dramatically shifted to Asia and that continent's megacities are poised to become leaders in providing high levels of local and global mobility; and (3) some developing world cities neglected in the world cities literature have invested in global over local mobility.},

  abstract = {The ability to access places of opportunity is dependent on the land use distribution, the transportation network connecting homes and activity sites, and sociodemographic-dependent mobility. Accessibility indicators are used as a planning tool to capture accessibility variations in the assessment and development of social, land use, and transportation policy. A number of metrics have been proposed to understand patterns of unequal access that typically fall under overlapping three pairs of contrasting notions of accessibility: place- versus person-based, normative versus positive, and potential versus actual. Variations in accessibility for different people in different locations might arise from the dynamic nature of the people\textendash space\textendash transportation triad. What is less explored is how these dynamics, resulting from the confluence of changing urban structures, diverging mobility resources, and socioeconomic transformations, might reveal unusual accessibility experiences based on unexpected travel time and distance relations. Quite simply, longer (shorter) distances can be traversed in shorter (longer) travel times than would be expected given a specific people\textendash space\textendash transportation situation. Using this linear and nonlinear perspective on time\textendash distance relations, we define a new pair of contrasting notions: monotonic versus nonmonotonic accessibility to investigate diverging commuting experiences. We demonstrate this idea by performing a place-based analysis of commuting data disaggregated by poverty status in the Denver metropolitan area. We find that (1) unexpected commuting experiences do exist and constitute a signification portion of commutes; (2) accessibility variations that are generally not anticipated by traditional place-based metrics; and (3) expected and inverted commuting experiences exist adjacent to each other.},

  abstract = {In response to the demand for improved mobility in metropolitan areas, the 1990s saw the development of a new transport system in Europe known as the tram-train. This system is based on using conventional railway lines with a low traffic density to extend urban tram (streetcar) or light rail services without changing vehicles, incorporating them into railway traffic. The tram-train enables a wider range and scope of direct transport services and reduces waiting and transfer time. The operation of light rail vehicles on conventional railway infrastructure requires the solution of numerous technical issues, such as traction power supply system, rolling stock design, gage compatibility, tire and rail profile, structural strength, passenger access, and signaling. Such problems are described and their solution by services now operating, or in advanced planning stages, worldwide is discussed.},

It explores\&nbsp;their potential outcomes, particularly in terms of how it can contribute to Green Growth and looks at developing indicators to monitor compact city and track policy performance. It reviews\&nbsp;compact city policies currently being implemented across the OECD in relation to the pursuit of Green Growth objectives and provides ideas to achieve better outcomes. And it assesses the key governance challenges faced by decision-makers as they seek to implement practical compact city strategies. This report is thus intended as "food for thought" for national, sub-national and municipal governments as they seek to address their economic and environmental challenges through the development and implementation of spatial strategies in pursuit of Green Growth objectives. It also illustrates best practices (which present key elements of successful compact city policies) based on empirical evidence that can be shared across OECD member countries.},

  abstract = {Giant strides in information technology at the turn of the century may have unleashed unreachable goals. With the invention of groupware, people expect to communicate easily with each other and accomplish difficult work even though they are remotely located or rarely overlap in time. Major corporations launch global teams, expecting that technology will make "virtual collocation" possible. Federal research money encourages global science through the establishment of "collaboratories." We review over 10 years of field and laboratory investigations of collocated and noncollocated synchronous group collaborations. In particular, we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible today and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow. We focus on the sociotechnical conditions required for effective distance work and bring together the results with four key concepts: common ground, coupling of work, collaboration readiness, and collaboration technology readiness. Groups with high common ground and loosely coupled work, with readiness both for collaboration and collaboration technology, have a chance at succeeding with remote work. Deviations from each of these create strain on the relationships among teammates and require changes in the work or processes of collaboration to succeed. Often they do not succeed because distance still matters.}

  abstract = {R\'esum\'e Cet article propose une approche quantitative globale de la mobilit\'e, int\'egrant les pratiques des personnes sur trois segments~: la mobilit\'e locale de semaine, la mobilit\'e locale de fin de semaine et la mobilit\'e \`a longue distance. Une premi\`ere partie \'evalue globalement ces diff\'erents march\'es et montre le poids croissant de la mobilit\'e \`a longue distance. L'analyse de chacun de ces march\'es, puis de la mobilit\'e globale est conduite ensuite suivant la position dans le cycle de vie, la localisation r\'esidentielle et le niveau de revenu. Enfin, les r\^oles respectifs de la localisation et du revenu dans la formation de la demande sur les diff\'erents march\'es sont \'etudi\'es dans la partie centrale du cycle de vie. On montre notamment l'absence de compensation entre la mobilit\'e de semaine et la mobilit\'e de fin de semaine, mais on note des interactions non n\'egligeables entre la mobilit\'e locale et la mobilit\'e \`a longue distance, notamment avec la localisation r\'esidentielle. Abstract This paper proposes a comprehensive quantitative approach to travel analysis that considers personal travel practices with regard to three travel market segments: local weekday travel, local weekend travel and long-distance travel. The first section consists of an evaluation of the overall size of these segments and demonstrates the increasing importance of long-distance travel. Each market segment and then travel as a whole are then analyzed according to individuals' position in the life cycle, residential location and income level. Last, the roles of location and income in the creation of travel demand in the different segments are then investigated for individuals in the middle part of the life cycle. In particular, it is demonstrated that weekend and weekday travel do not compensate for one another, but there are significant interactions between both local and long-distance travel, and, in particular, residential location.},

  abstract = {The assessment of the impacts of high-speed rail (HSR) projects on territorial cohesion has recently emerged as an important issue for transport planners. HSR networks are usually designed to interconnect strong economic centers efficiently. Hence, the greatest improvements in accessibility concentrate near HSR stations, whereas intermediate locations suffer from comparatively lower accessibility benefits. Negative territorial cohesion impacts appear if HSR ultimately results in a more polarized spatial distribution of accessibility levels. There has so far been little research aimed at exploring the implications of the definition of the geographical limits of study area in the measurement of HSR territorial cohesion impacts. In this context, this paper presents a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based methodology which analyzes changes in the territorial distribution of accessibility resulting from HSR investments. These changes are analyzed at different planning levels, in order to assess the sensitivity of territorial cohesion results to scale definition. The methodology is tested by its application to the development of the 670 km of the Galician (north-western) HSR corridor included in the Spanish PEIT (Strategic Transport and Infrastructure Plan) 2005\textendash 2020. Cohesion impacts are assessed at different direct planning levels: regional, corridor and national levels, as well from the perspective of spillover effects. In all cases, the construction of the HSR corridor increases the accessibility values, and results show positive cohesion effects at the national and corridor levels, whereas at the regional level both balancing and polarization effects appear. These differences are mainly due to the location of HSR stations or to the quality of the transport network from the surrounding cities to the station, which determines the territorial distribution of accessibility improvements. Similar results are found from the spillover perspective.},

Two approaches to the measurement of accessibility aggregate accessibility measures and the space-time geography framework are described. It is suggested that isochrones (lines of equal travel time) are a natural way to combine these approaches in a GIS setting. A desktop GIS application has been developed which can automatically generate isochrones for travel by public transport. The application successfully copes with the complexity of the public transport of a large city (Glasgow), comprising bus, rail, and underground services. Journeys may include an initial walk to a public transport stop, several interchanges between services of the same or different modes, and a final walk. Options provide for plotting isochrones for journeys by bus only or train only; and for exact or approximate isochrones, the latter generated more quickly. The application is described in some detail, and assessed. Sample outputs are presented, including an example involving further processing of isochrones to produce a constrained accessibility map, which demonstrates the generality of this approach.},

  abstract = {In many European cities, railway stations have become urban hubs in which a variety of functions and uses are focused. These include retail, caf\'es, offices and housing. They are often also complemented by adjacent amenity open space, in both hard and soft landscaping, alongside a broader provision for other modes, such as public transport, walking and cycling. In this sense, large-scale transport hubs resemble small-scale city centres and, like other urban centres, the public space in stations should meet the needs of a wide range of users. The design and management of railway stations is highly complex and the risk of such nodes failing as quality public spaces is significant. In addition, railway stations play a pivotal role in encouraging public transport use and they have the potential to contribute to a modal shift from more polluting transport modes. We argue that the design and management of such spaces is a key variable in the modal choices many travellers make. Based on empirical research across Europe, this paper presents a set of indicators for assessing the quality of railway stations and their adjacent areas and summarizes our research findings to increase the attractiveness of rail journeys through enhanced public spaces.},

This paper examines the case of the Paris region. Based on a logistic regression model using municipal-level employment data (1993\textendash 2008), it aims at assessing whether municipalities with small amounts of employment are likely to experience high employment growth depending on their location vis-\`a-vis transport infrastructures. Motorways are found to have an influence for very small areas and airports for bigger ones. However, the role of transport infrastructures is rather limited when the analysis is differentiated according to economic sectors.},

They can influence the attractiveness of locations near the stations and improve accessibility for these locations. Furthermore urban rail can improve a location's attractiveness by its image effect: it makes a station appear modern and dynamic, and thus raises the status of this location. This paper summarises findings on the land-use and economic impacts of the urban rail system of the city of Naples over time and space. It examines changes in residential and non-residential (offices and retail) property prices around the newly built stations between 2001 and 2008 as well as the changes in the number of residents for the same station catchment areas. Ad hoc station control areas have been specified in order to compare the results of these changes. Results show that values in station control areas are lower than those of those of the stations catchment areas.},

Starting from the question of how urban and transport planners are designing AIs, the article analyzes and describes the AIs developed over the last decade (mainly in Europe), offering a structured overview and a clear categorization of how accessibility measures can be applied. The paper identifies AI characteristics, and considers their usability, based on AI developer perceptions.},

  abstract = {The extent of the city is important in a number of respects, not least in relation to the question of city size, an issue of considerable significance in urban and regional analysis. Four definitions of the city are considered here. The first involves the city as a physical entity, or the area devoted to primarily urban uses. This Built City (BC) is perhaps the most familiar perception of the city, largely because it is relatively easy to visualise. The BC forms the core or basis of each of the other three definitions of the city. These are as follows: the Consumption City (an area within which most of the consumption of goods and services occurs in the BC); the Employment City (an area in which the bulk of the employed workforce works in the BC); and the Workforce City (an area upon which the BC draws for a given majority of its labour requirements). These four definitions of the city are brought together and shown to be interrelated.

  abstract = {The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT) has been argued to affect time use patterns in a variety of ways, with consequent impacts on travel behaviour. While there exists a significant body of empirical studies documenting these effects, theoretical developments have lagged this empirical work and in particular, microeconomic time allocation models have not to date been fully extended to accommodate the implications of an increasingly digitised society. To address this gap, we present a modelling framework, grounded in time allocation theories and the goods\textendash leisure framework, for joint modelling of the choice of mode of activity (physical versus tele-activity), travel mode and route, and ICT bundle. By providing the expression for a conditional indirect utility function, we use hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate how our framework can conceptualise various activity\textendash travel decision situations. In our scenarios we assume a variety of situations such as the implications of severe weather, the introduction of autonomous vehicles, and the interaction between multiple decision makers. Moreover, our approach lays the microeconomic foundations for deriving subjective values of ICT qualities such as broadband speed or connection reliability. Finally, we also demonstrate the means by which our framework could be linked to various data collection protocols (stated preference exercises, diaries of social interactions, laboratory experiments) and modelling approaches (discrete choice modelling, hazard-based duration models).},

  abstract = {Climate changes and pollution are putting high pressure on finding more sustainable and effective transportation means. After Kyoto Protocol in 1997, Paris Agreement at COP 21 in 2015, and posterior announcements of limitations to internal combustion engine vehicles' (ICEV) sell and circulation by several key countries and cities are clear demonstrations of this increasing will. It is quite likely that a pure ICEV produced today will not be allowed to freely circulate everywhere during all the extension of its lifetime, especially if it is a diesel car. Therefore, every major car manufacturer is announcing new electrified models for the next years and some of them are stating that all their models will be electrified in less than 5 years. As a consequence of the impressive price decrease and performance improvement of the batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs), the typical battery capacity of a regular passenger car rose from 20-24 kWh to 30-40 kWh in just 3 years without significant car price increase. The total cost of ownership (TCO) of the EVs is approaching and will be lower than that of ICEV in less than 5 years. In some cases, the TCO is already lower than that of ICEV. Autonomous cars and the shift from individual car ownership to transportation sharing poses additional challenges. In this paper, the main trends and technical challenges related to the electrification of the road transportation are presented, as well as some defies for the transportation sector.},

  abstract = {Empirical studies on R\&D collaborations between universities and firms have mainly centered their attention on universities and firms' characteristics that favor the establishment of collaborative agreements. In this paper, I extend the current research framework investigating the role that specific technological and relational attributes may play on the relevance of such collaborations. Specifically, I focus on the effects exerted by three relevant factors, namely technological relatedness, prior collaboration ties, and geographical distance, on university\textendash industry joint innovation value. I develop testable hypotheses about their impact on the innovative performance of R\&D university\textendash industry collaborations, and test them on a sample of 796 university\textendash industry joint patents, developed by 33 universities located in 12 different European countries. Our results suggest that partners' technological relatedness has an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation value. In addition, prior ties and geographical distance between universities and firms are both positively related to the achievement of higher innovative outcomes.},

Chaque situation se pr\'esente comme la combinaison de plusieurs param\`etres.

Au fil du questionnaire, ses r\'eponses r\'ev\`eleront l'importance qu'il donne \`a chaque param\`etre et contribueront \`a une meilleure appr\'ehension de ses pr\'ef\'erences et de ses choix. Ce travail s'articule autour de trois \'etudes de cas mises en \oe uvre dans le cadre d'\'etudes men\'ees par des op\'erateurs de transport (SNCF - th\`eme : r\'eforme de tarification sociale), des gestionnaires d'infrastructure (RFF - th\`eme : effets du cadencement sur l'attractivit\'e du train) ou des organismes de recherche (LET et PREDIT - th\`eme : impact de politiques de rationnement du carburant sur la mobilit\'e automobile).

  abstract = {Aim The rate at which similarity in species composition decays with increasing distance was investigated among communities of parasitic helminths in different populations of the same host species. Rates of distance decay in similarity of parasite communities were compared between populations of fish and mammal hosts, which differ with respect to their vagility and potential to disperse parasite species over large distances. Location Data on helminth communities were compiled for several populations of three mammalian host species (Ondatra zibethicus, Procyon lotor and Canis latrans) and three fish host species (Perca flavescens, Catostomus commersoni and Esox lucius) from continental North America. Methods Distances between localities and similarity in the composition of helminth communities, the latter computed using the Jaccard index, were calculated for all possible pairs of host populations within each host species. Similarity values were then regressed against distance to see if they decayed at exponential rates, as reported for plant communities; the significance of the regressions was assessed using randomization tests. Results The number of hosts examined per population did not correlate with the number of helminth species found per population, and thus sampling effort is unlikely to have confounded the results. In four (two mammals and two fish) of the six host species, similarity in helminth communities decayed exponentially with distance. When the log of similarity is plotted against untransformed distance, the slopes obtained for the two fish species are lower than those obtained for the two mammalian host species. Main conclusions Similarity in the composition of parasite communities appears to decay exponentially with increasing distance in some host species, but not in all host species. The rate of decay is not necessarily associated with the vagility of the host. Although distance decay of similarity is generally occurring, it seems that other ecological processes, related either to the host or its habitat, can obscure it.},

  abstract = {A la modernit\'e actuelle est associ\'ee une disparition des routines individuelles. Reflets de l'action traditionnelle, ces derni\`eres cadrent mal avec l'id\'eal de fluidit\'e et de mouvement permanent. Pour autant plusieurs contributions de cet ouvrage montrent qu'il ne faut pas conclure trop vite \`a la disparition des routines. Derri\`ere l'id\'ee de routines, se trouve celle d'habitudes, activit\'es r\'ep\'et\'ees et fortement int\'erioris\'ees par les individus. Un des niveaux dans lequel elles s'inscrivent est celui m\^eme de la vie de tous les jours (C.Javeau, 2006). Ainsi les individus utilisent au quotidien ces routines en les construisant eux-m\^emes de fa\c{c}on r\'eflexive (F.Ascher, 2006). Leur existence est le t\'emoignage d'une r\'esistance et incite \`a relativiser les impacts suppos\'es de la modernit\'e actuelle. En effet, cette derni\`ere s'inscrit r\'esolument dans le pr\'esent et dans l'al\'eatoire symbole de libert\'e, refusant toute planification ou r\'egularit\'e. La valorisation du temps imm\'ediat r\'efute l'id\'ee de routine. Avec l'instauration d'un nouveau rapport au temps, la modernit\'e actuelle semble \'egalement s'affranchir de l'id\'ee d'espace. Les activit\'es sociales seraient de moins en moins ancr\'ees spatialement car de moins en moins routini\`eres. Ainsi perte de sens du spatial et disparition des routines sont li\'ees en vertu d'un culte moderne du temps imm\'ediat. Au confluent de cette transformation de l'espace et du temps, se pose la question de la place du travail dans nos soci\'et\'es. Il se diluerait, serait moins attach\'e \`a un lieu d\'elimit\'e. Dans le contexte de la mondialisation, l'entreprise n'est plus un lieu unifi\'e mais plut\^ot une multitude de lieux. L'\'eclatement du p\'erim\`etre des entreprises renvoie \`a celui de leurs clients et leurs fournisseurs. Dans le but d'entretenir des relations avec ses partenaires, une firme a aussi recours \`a des employ\'es de plus en plus mobiles. Ce regain de mobilit\'e professionnelle physique se traduit par des lieux de travail de plus en plus variables et temporaires (G.Crague, 2004). Avec la distance, le cadre du travail serait moins apte \`a r\'eguler les comportements des individus. Il le serait d'autant moins qu'il occupe une part d\'ecroissante dans la vie des individus. La diminution tendancielle du temps de travail lib\`ere les individus d'un temps contraint et routinier au profit des loisirs, du temps libre comme lieu de cr\'eation autonome (G.Friedmann, cit\'e par C.Javeau, ibid.). Enfin, la moindre capacit\'e \`a r\'eguler les actions des travailleurs se mat\'erialise sur le lieu de travail. Les technologies de l'information et de la communication tel Internet permettent de s'en absoudre tout en \'etant physiquement pr\'esent (G.Cette, 2004). Faire ses courses, avoir des communications priv\'ees sont autant d'activit\'es qui peuvent \^etre effectu\'ees au travail constituant une \'echappatoire \guillemotleft{} virtuelle \guillemotright. Ces exemples font partie d'un ensemble d'\'evolutions socio\'economiques r\'ecentes qui renforcent la th\`ese d'un travail qui se dissout dans l'espace et dans le temps, qui ne serait plus en mesure de produire des routines m\^eme \`a sa proximit\'e imm\'ediate. Ces \'evolutions et leur impact sont \`a relativiser. L'objectif est ici de voir en quoi le travail structure le comportement des individus qui y s\'ejournent par la production de routines \`a sa proximit\'e temporelle mais surtout spatiale. L'int\'er\^et est double. D'un point de vue sociologique, il s'agit de montrer la permanence d'\'el\'ements qui \guillemotleft{} contraignent \guillemotright{} l'individu au travail sur le plan spatiotemporel malgr\'e l'\'electivit\'e et la libert\'e suppos\'ees de la modernit\'e actuelle. D'un point de vue urbanistique, l'enjeu est de comprendre comment l'am\'enagement des environnements o\`u s'ins\`erent les lieux du travail peut influer sur la structuration ou la d\'estructuration des routines spatiales associ\'ees au travail. A travers deux enqu\^etes distinctes, nous allons voir que l'environnement de travail reste un cadre d'actions, un lieu de routines spatiotemporelles. La premi\`ere enqu\^ete a eu lieu dans le quartier d'affaires de La D\'efenses (92) en 2006. La seconde s'est d\'eroul\'ee sur les sites de l'op\'eration Paris Plages en 2007. Ces deux enqu\^etes comportaient des objectifs diff\'erents. La premi\`ere avait pour ambition de rendre compte des usages du site de La D\'efense alors que la seconde entendait mesurer les pratiques et perceptions de l'am\'enagement festif et \'eph\'em\`ere dont b\'en\'eficient les berges de la Seine depuis 2002. Ces enqu\^etes se sont av\'er\'ees compl\'ementaires pour montrer la persistance de routines spatiales autours du travail par leur insertion dans un cadre de travail. En tant que quartier d'affaire, cette insertion est \'evidente pour La D\'efense. Moins \'evidente pour Paris Plages, elle existe \'egalement : les sites de la manifestation sont \`a proximit\'e imm\'ediate de nombreuse entreprises et donc de leurs salari\'es. La sp\'ecificit\'e de Paris-Plages r\'eside dans son caract\`ere \'ev\'enementiel et r\'ecr\'eatif. Ses concepteurs ont pour but de travailler la rupture avec le quotidien en faisant en sorte \guillemotleft{} et c'est l'int\'er\^et de l'\'eph\'em\`ere, que les gens croient en un espace et en tr\`es peu de temps \guillemotright{} et en fournissant la possibilit\'e de vivre \guillemotleft{} une \'echapp\'ee belle [...] une journ\'ee o\`u l'emploi du temps n'est plus r\'egl\'e \`a l'avance \guillemotright. Nous allons voir que, malgr\'e ce v\oe u pieux, Paris Plages (PP) rend compte de routines spatiales autours du travail tels qu'elles ont d'abord pu \^etre observ\'ees \`a La D\'efense (LD).},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the substratum and infrastructure networks as relevant components of spatial planning. Since 2001, in Dutch government documents on spatial planning the Layers Approach has been presented, with three layers: substratum; networks; occupation patterns. The Layers Approach assumes that the characteristics of the substratum provide conditions for infrastructure networks and that these infrastructure networks then condition the occupation patterns, including the locations for housing, business activities and related services. These more or less hierarchical relationships are supposed to produce clear ground rules for the spatial planner. The Layers Approach seems to offer a robust methodology for spatial planning. This contribution presents the background of the Layers Approach, adds some critical notes and proposes an amendment: the Network Approach, connecting different spatial scales. After the presentation of a typology of networks a preliminary overview of the dynamics of transport networks is given. The spatial relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) networks, that support transport networks, is discussed. Nodes are presented as links between infrastructure networks and occupation patterns. The paper concludes that actors, dealing with regional spatial plans in a decentralized planning system, have to acquire an in-depth knowledge of the technology, economy and governance of current networks and the qualities of the substratum, which form a conditioning and stimulating framework for the spatial planning of urban and regional areas.

  abstract = {Indian cities face a transport crisis characterized by levels of congestion, noise, pollution, traffic fatalities and injuries, and inequity far exceeding those in most European and North American cities. India's transport crisis has been exacerbated by the extremely rapid growth of India's largest cities in a context of low incomes, limited and outdated transport infrastructure, rampant suburban sprawl, sharply rising motor vehicle ownership and use, deteriorating bus services, a wide range of motorized and non-motorized transport modes sharing roadways, and inadequate as well as uncoordinated land use and transport planning. This article summarizes key trends in India's transport system and travel behavior, analyzes the extent and causes of the most severe problems, and recommends nine policy improvements that would help mitigate India's urban transport crisis.},

Malgr\'e le fait que plusieurs d\'enoncent les erreurs math\'ematiques de Walter Christaller, ses hypoth\`eses irr\'ealistes, la non-ad\'equation de son mod\`ele \`a la r\'ealit\'e ou son lourd pass\'e totalitaire, on voit appara\^itre, dispara\^itre, puis r\'eappara\^itre des hexagones, id\'ee fixe ou image id\'eale qui hante la pens\'ee des g\'eographes et des am\'enageurs.

Pourquoi donc tant d'auteurs, venant d'horizons diff\'erents sur le plan scientifique (g\'eographes ou am\'enageurs), politique (partisans de r\'egimes totalitaires ou d\'emocrates) ou national (Estonie, Allemagne, Autriche, Suisse), ont-ils perdur\'e dans la d\'efense d'un syst\`eme condamn\'e d\`es les d\'ebuts~?Certains parmi ces g\'eographes appellent cependant \`a un changement de paradigme d\`es la fin du 20e si\`ecle. On voit aussi appara\^itre, parfois m\^eme chez des auteurs encore fascin\'es par l'hexagone, des notions qui contredisent partiellement ou totalement le syst\`eme christall\'erien~: \guillemotleft ~d\'ecentralisation concentr\'ee~\guillemotright, \guillemotleft ~concentration d\'ecentrale~\guillemotright, \guillemotleft ~d\'econcentration~\guillemotright{} ou \guillemotleft ~structure polycentrique~\guillemotright{} du syst\`eme urbain.

  abstract = {One of the direct effects of introducing high-speed railway lines is a significant reduction in travel times between major cities. This is particularly relevant in mountain areas. It not only makes cities more easily reachable with more sustainable transport systems but can also encourage different travel behavior and reduce environmental pressures on sensitive areas. A comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal effects of the introduction of high-speed railways in the Alpine arc has not yet been developed. To help fill this gap, this study uses multidimensional scaling and the geographical information system to illustrate the time\textendash space compression. This term indicates the erosion of spatial and temporal distances in the areas of the Alps directly affected by the new railway lines. Six trans-Alpine high-speed railway lines are analyzed, comparing current and projected travel times by train. A time-based map is created to show the time\textendash space compression in every transversal direction, particularly on the French and the Austrian side of the Alps. Implications in terms of local accessibility are also analyzed, focusing on the Autonomous Province of Bolzano/Bozen-South Tyrol. Finally, the paper discusses the importance of time-based maps for the understanding of sociospatial dynamics and the possible implications for spatial development.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}br/{$>$}Spatial labour markets are subjected to the forces of regional economic activity and competing network effects. Commuting is, therefore, an important equilibrating vehicle in a City Network constellation. Cities act as attractors of commuters, as most economic activity occurs in cities, thus providing a high share of attractive workplaces. Cities that are centrally connected in a network may act as both centripetal and centrifugal forces in the whole system. The present paper focuses on what is named the City Network (CN) approach. A central idea is the accessibility concept, which is interpreted here as the potential of opportunity for interaction, which has a positive impact on economic growth. In our paper, the accessibility concept and the CN concept are linked together by positioning accessibility in the CN system. Since accessibility measures give geographical insights into the distribution of economic activities and the related (dis)equilibrium of regional development patterns, the connection with the labour market is evident, and, therefore, a second focus of our analysis.{$<$}br/{$>$}In an applied setting, our paper aims to investigate spatial accessibility patterns in the main CN in Germany. The 17 districts which belong to the country's CN were chosen from the 439 German labour market districts on the basis of three criteria: (a) their connection to the high speed railway network; (b) the most accessible districts according to previous results (2002); (c) relevant districts for the German economy. Our applied modelling research concerns home-to-work commuters travelling between the selected districts belonging to the German CN, for both 2003 and 2007. Here, a comparative analysis of the ranking of the most accessible districts - also for different intra-zonal travel times - is carried out in order to map out the changes in accessibility between 2003 and 2007, especially in the light of new high speed connections and commuting flow dynamics.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to test the validity of the radical analysis framework of neoliberalization, heavily influenced by urban studies in the Anglo-American world, by transposing it to analyse French urban policies. It claims that French cities, which were thought to be protected by a Weberian model of bureaucracy, are not immune to this neoliberalization of public policies (Le Gal\`es, 2003). But it also claims that this occurs through mechanisms other than the influence of revanchist coalitions on urban governance (Smith, 1996). Favouring a Foulcauldian approach, the microphysics of diffuse power, we have tried to link the neo-Marxist metacritique of domination to an empirical micro-analysis of the mechanisms present in the pluralist city. Using empirical analyses carried out in various French cities, this article provides a critical view of contemporary urban transport planning and sustainable mobility policies. These policies implemented in the name of promoting "the quality of life" and sustainable mobility contribute to a disturbing specialization in treating spaces. They focus on urban operations and tools (that often come with key adjectives such as green, citizen, eco-responsible, clean, civilized, soft, or calm) that specialize and classify spaces, flows, uses and users in the city. A social system (social roles and practices) and a spatial system (locations, types and quality of space) combine to suggest who can move about in the different areas of the planned ideal city. Depoliticization, naturalization and the emphasis placed on individual responsibility are strong, coordinated trends in framing these contemporary public problems as well as major processes that structurally elude their socio-spatial aspects, restrict the space for controversy and discredit groups that nonetheless object to the application of these public policies. Legitimized by "noble causes" such as preserving an acceptable environment for future generations as well as people's safety and health, these policies impose "the right way" of behaving in the post-Fordist neo-hygienist city.},

Nous d\'eveloppons un indicateur \'elabor\'e par Beaucire (2004), l'intensit\'e nodale, pour mesurer la qualit\'e des correspondances et identifier les points de blocage et les marges de manoeuvre pour am\'eliorer la combinaison des offres de transports. La mise \`a disposition d'un outil op\'eratoire alimentant une organisation des r\'eseaux par noeud et non seulement par ligne contribue \`a une meilleure prise en compte de la " dimension station " face \`a la " dimension circulation " (Dupuy, 1992).

The methods are based on estimates of the market area for a new shop; the main difference between the methods is that the first one (proximity count in competition) assumes deterministic, strictly bounded market areas whereas the other methods (gravity surface and pressure map) assume non-deterministic, fuzzy market areas. These methods can be used to estimate the market area for a single, new facility. We show that two of these methods (the proximity count in competition and the pressure map) can be adapted to estimate the total market area of a chain after locating one new facility for that chain. In the conclusions, we discuss the applicability of the methods in different planning contexts.},

  abstract = {Schematic maps are an important component of assistance for navigating transport networks worldwide. By showing routes as simple straight lines, they reduce the cognitive load of journey planning, and by revealing the underlying structure of networks, they make their key features easier to identify and learn. However, although there are many suggestions for optimizing schematic maps so as to maximize these benefits, to date these have not been directly supported by published usability studies or psychological theory. In this paper, we suggest that there are circumstances in which conventional schematic maps fail to yield benefits, and we compare journey planning using the current official RATP Paris Metro map with an all-curves design which replaces straight lines and corners with gentle curves. Three separate usability studies with slightly different methodologies showed that the journey planning time for the all-curves map was better than the RATP version, with effect sizes ranging from 0.48 to 1.12. Subjective usability ratings were derived from questionnaires, and user preferences, but neither were correlated with objective usability measures. We conclude that (1) in terms of designing schematics, there is no evidence to suggest that any rule-set can be claimed to be a gold-standard, and it is important to match the design rules to the properties of the network, (2) in some circumstances, radical departures from traditional ideas can yield usability benefits, and (3) map usability appears to be distinct from map engagement, although the latter is undoubtedly important in encouraging people fully to make use of navigation aides.},

  abstract = {This expanded and revised fourth edition of The Geography of Transport Systems provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the field with a broad overview of its concepts, methods and areas of application. Aimed mainly at an undergraduate audience, it provides an overview of the spatial aspects of transportation and focuses on how the mobility of passengers and freight is linked with geography.  The book is divided in ten chapters, each covering a specific conceptual dimension, including networks, modes, terminals, freight transportation, urban transportation and environmental impacts, and updated with the latest information available. The fourth edition offers new material on the issues of transport and the economy, city logistics, supply chains, security, energy, the environment, as well as a revised content structure. With over 160 updated photographs, figures and maps, The Geography of Transport Systems presents transportation systems at different scales ranging from global to local and focuses on different contexts such as North America, Europe and East Asia.  This volume is an essential resource for undergraduates studying transport geography, as well as those interested in economic and urban geography, transport planning and engineering.

In this article, we present an agenda for empirical research on this user and the interactive designs he or she employs. The research agenda is a result of a multi-stage discussion among international scholars facilitated by the International Cartographic Association that included an early round of position papers and two subsequent workshops to narrow into pressing themes and important research opportunities. The focus of our discussion is epistemological and reflects the wide interdisciplinary influences on user studies in cartography. The opportunities are presented as imperatives that cross basic research and user-centered design studies, and identify practical impediments to empirical research, emerging interdisciplinary recommendations to improve user studies, and key research needs specific to the study of interactive maps and visualizations.},

  abstract = {Background: Public transport has health benefits for the environment and individuals. People walk to access public transport and there are proportionately fewer crashes and less pollution than with private cars. Yet transport planning rests on assumptions that privilege speed and private cars over other modes. This study, set at a crossroads between public health and transport studies, questioned adult passengers in two New Zealand cities about their public transport travel time use and experiences. Theories about social contact informed the study.    Research questions and methods: The main research question was: How do passengers use and value their public transport travel time and what is its value for wellbeing? Sub-questions addressed variations between population groups and different transport modes (bus and train), and how passengers felt travel time use affects their health and wellbeing.  A sequential mixed methods research design and abductive approach within the pragmatist paradigm were used. Three phases of data collection with adult passengers were: (1) structured observations of 812 passengers in Wellington; (2) telephone interviews with 48 passengers in Auckland and Wellington, and (3) a survey distributed to 2000 passengers in Auckland and Wellington (responses=1039). Results: Structured observations showed frequent travel time activities were looking ahead or out the window; reading; listening on headphones and talking. There were differences among activities according to transport mode, gender and age-group.  Interviews found positive health/ wellbeing impacts from the `down time', or `time out' experienced during travel time, and also from the activities passengers undertook while waiting and travelling. The survey (response rate: 52\%) found the most common waiting time activities were: people-watching; watching for the public transport service to arrive (especially buses); thinking, and day-dreaming. Frequent in-vehicle activities for both modes were window-gazing and thinking; over half of the sample did these. Over a third also did people-watching, day-dreaming and relaxing, and over a quarter reported reading for leisure and making personal texts/phone calls. Differences by mode, gender and age are reported. While nearly 38\% of survey respondents found waiting a waste of time, only half that proportion found their in-vehicle travel time a waste. Nearly half (47.8\%) of the respondents thought their travel time use had no effect either way on their health/ wellbeing; 46.7\% thought it had a positive effect. Very few identified a negative impact.  Discussion: The mixed methods design worked well in answering the research questions. Bus and train passenger participants were actively doing something while travelling. Their activities and inactivities had meanings for them. Many considered that how they spent their travel time affected their health and wellbeing. More felt that they made use of their travel time than considered it wasted.  Results contributed to new theories of the `public transport neighbourhood' and the possibilities of public transport places as public places rich in human interaction and personal meaning. There are implications for further research, and for improvements supporting positive travel time use at both the structural and service levels. Transport policy needs to take better account of travel time use.},

  abstract = {Improvements in accessibility are increasingly suggested as strategies leading to a reduction in vehicular travel, congestion, pollution and their related impacts. This approach assumes that individuals, if offered an opportunity, are likely to reduce their travel. It also assumes that accessibility-enhancing land-use changes will increase transit and non-motorized trips in lieu of automobile usage. However, there are numerous indications that people engage in excess travel and are not necessarily inclined to reduce it. The paper presents a number of hypotheses on the reasons for excess travel and the relationships among attitudes toward travel and responses to accessibility-enhancing strategies. It suggests that different market segments are likely to respond to policy measures in different ways. In particular, if a large segment of the population prefers mobility over the reduced travel offered by accessibility improvements, then such policies will be less effective than anticipated.

  abstract = {Without questioning the fact that to achieve efficiency emitters should pay for the true costs of their actions (a core principle of economic policies such as pollution taxes), we find sufficient evidence in the literature to demonstrate that many other policy instruments can be used in combination with taxes and permits to ensure that the transport needs of the present generation can be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet any needs of their own. The policies and policy aspects considered in this paper broadly fall into three categories: physical policies, soft policies, and knowledge policies. All three aim to bring about changes in consumers' and firms' behaviour, but in different ways. The first category includes policies with a physical infrastructure element: public transport, land use, walking and cycling, road construction, and freight transport. We also consider the particular challenges for mobility in developing countries, and how these may be addressed. Soft policies, on the other hand, are non-tangible aiming to bring about behavioural change by informing actors about the consequences of their transport choices, and potentially persuading them to change their behaviour. These measures include car sharing and car pooling, teleworking and teleshopping, eco-driving, as well as general information and advertising campaigns. Finally, knowledge policies emphasise the important role of investment in research and development for a sustainable model of mobility for the future. The main findings can be summarised as follows. Physical policies An increase in the use of public transport, combined with a decrease in the use of private cars, can reduce traffic congestion and, more importantly, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as public transport generally causes lower CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre than private cars. Public transport fares are subsidised in most places, which can be justified by economies of scale and by the fact that public transport can reduce total road transport externalities. London, Singapore, Portland and Curitiba are all examples of good practice at government level, having achieved reliable, frequent and integrated public transport. Policies to increase public transport use must be part of an integrated policy. Integrated policy refers to integration across different modes of transport, different government objectives (such as the economy, health and the environment), considering the needs of different social groups, and coordinating action between the relevant government institutions. There is evidence that a lack of coordination can jeopardise the achievement of policy objectives. A sustainable model for transport policy also requires integration with land-use policies. These may be somewhat limited within the bounds of existing cities, but as cities grow and new cities are built, urban planners must put more emphasis on land use for sustainable transport in order to reduce congestion and CO2 emissions. Sustainable land-use policy can direct urban development towards a form that allows public transport as well as walking and cycling to be at the core of urban mobility. Walking and cycling, which improve general health and produce no tailpipe emissions, constitute an excellent alternative to motorised transport on short-distance trips within towns and cities. The policies which can incentivise walking and cycling include crime reduction to make streets safer, well-maintained and clean pavements, attractive street furniture, safe crossings with shorter waiting times, dedicated cycle paths, showers in offices, and lower speed limits, to name but a few. Road construction and expansion used to be seen as one of the most promising ways to reduce traffic congestion. However, in the mid-1990s, the issue was reassessed and it was found that building and expanding roads, increased, rather than decreased, congestion, and ultimately induced higher levels of travel demand. The reason for this is that the extra capacity reduces the general cost of travelling and the less expensive the travel, the more it will be demanded. Regarding freight modal shift, road transport is much more polluting than rail per tonne-km of goods transported and therefore a shift towards greater use of rail in freight transport is desirable. Inadequate infrastructure is the main obstacle preventing this modal shift taking place. Developing countries face great mobility challenges: rural areas are often extremely poorly connected to transport infrastructure, such that, in contrast to the situation in developed countries, the benefits of road construction can strongly outweigh the total costs (including environmental ones). The main challenge, however, is to develop a solution to the problems arising from the combination of urbanisation and motorisation. Integration of transport and land-use policy will be key to rising to this challenge. Soft policies Car sharing and car clubs can also potentially reduce CO2 emissions, although the aggregate reduction in congestion and emissions has not been measured with an adequate degree of precision in the literature. Teleworking and teleshopping can potentially reduce congestion and also CO2 emissions. However, the evidence for this reduction is rather mixed, as it is unclear whether these measures lead to overall reductions in road transport. Eco-driving campaigns aim to inform and educate drivers in order to induce them to drive in a fuel-efficient and thus environmentally friendly way. There seems to be some consensus in the literature that eco-driving could lead to reductions in CO2 emissions of around 10 per cent. Information and education policies have often been advocated as instruments which may affect behavioural change. We find in this paper that these types of measures are necessary, but not sufficient for behavioural change. Advertising and marketing may go a long way in changing peoples' behaviour. In California, for example, Kahn (2007) finds the ``Prius'' effect: the Toyota Prius is preferred by consumers relative to other similarly green vehicles, probably due to extensive marketing and celebrity endorsements. Family life changes are also found to trigger changes in behaviour (Goodwin, 1989, 2008). People whose lives are being changed by some important development (birth of a child, retirement, etc) tend to respond more to changes in the relative attractiveness of different transport modes. Advertising campaigns promoting a modal shift towards public transport, for instance, may thus be more successful if targeted at people in the process of important life transitions. Knowledge policies Research and Development is crucial for developing sustainable and low-carbon transport for the future, and it is essential that governments provide incentives to undertake R\&amp;D, so that new low-carbon technologies in the transport sector can be demonstrated and applied at a large scale. Finally, we consider the issue of policy combination and integration. There is evidence that the combination and integration of policies can lead to positive side-effects and synergies. Policy integration is crucial in order to rise to the challenges we face in moving towards a sustainable mobility model. We conclude that classical economic policies may be successfully combined with a number of policy measures discussed in this paper in order to achieve sustainability in transport.},

The underlying constraints, originally employed in urban traffic planning and never before applied to global scenarios, assume that humans invest fixed budgets of money and time for travel on average.

  abstract = {Transport studies and planning have traditionally considered mobility as a rational activity, necessitated by external factors and shaped by economic considerations. This has led to a focus on quantitative criteria as explanatory factors and left other aspects such as the travellers' perception of mobility and the links between mobility and other parts of life largely unexplored. But studies from cultural and social sciences show that mobility has wider implications, for instance, by serving psychological and social needs. The article undertakes a critical review of the evolution of transport planning, outlines the main elements of the discipline's worldview and explores the reasons for its difficulties in handling the `soft' dimensions of mobility such as comfort, ambience, sensual stimulation. It becomes clear that these difficulties can be traced back to the profession's origins in infrastructure design and economic assessment. The article considers the main criticisms of the traditional mindset and, focusing on travel as an activity, outlines some possibilities to make `soft' aspects more accessible from a planning perspective.},

  abstract = {The size of cities is known to play a fundamental role in social and economic life. Yet, its relation to the structure of the underlying network of human interactions has not been investigated empirically in detail. In this paper, we map society-wide communication networks to the urban areas of two European countries. We show that both the total number of contacts and the total communication activity grow superlinearly with city population size, according to well-defined scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase that affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability that an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains largely unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and scale-invariant acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as cities get bigger, which is numerically confirmed by applying epidemiological models to the studied networks. Our findings should provide a microscopic basis towards understanding the superlinear increase of different socioeconomic quantities with city size, that applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for instance, the creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain contagious diseases.},

Two linear regression equations, one for an A.M. peak-hour adjustment and one for a P.M. peak-hour adjustment, were developed using vehicle trip counts and easily measured site and surrounding area context variables from a sample of 50 smart-growth sites in California. Many of the contextual variables that were associated with lower vehicle trip generation at the smart-growth study sites were correlated. Therefore, variables representing characteristics such as residential population density, employment density, transit service, metered on-street parking, and building setback distance from the sidewalk were combined into a single ``smart-growth factor'' that was used in the linear regression equations. The A.M. peak-hour and P.M. peak-hour adjustment equations are only appropriate for planning-level analysis at sites in smart-growth areas. In addition, the method is only appropriate for single land uses in several common categories, such as office, mid- to high-density residential, restaurant, and coffee/donut shop. The method uses data from California, but the methodological approach could provide a framework for adjusting ITE trip-generation estimates in smart-growth areas throughout the United States.},

  abstract = {This article discusses empirical findings and conceptual elaborations of the last 10 years in strategic niche management research (SNM). The SNM approach suggests that sustainable innovation journeys can be facilitated by creating technological niches, i.e. protected spaces that allow the experimentation with the co-evolution of technology, user practices, and regulatory structures. The assumption was that if such niches were constructed appropriately, they would act as building blocks for broader societal changes towards sustainable development. The article shows how concepts and ideas have evolved over time and new complexities were introduced. Research focused on the role of various niche-internal processes such as learning, networking, visioning and the relationship between local projects and global rule sets that guide actor behaviour. The empirical findings showed that the analysis of these niche-internal dimensions needed to be complemented with attention to niche external processes. In this respect, the multi-level perspective proved useful for contextualising SNM. This contextualisation led to modifications in claims about the dynamics of sustainable innovation journeys. Niches are to be perceived as crucial for bringing about regime shifts, but they cannot do this on their own. Linkages with ongoing external processes are also important. Although substantial insights have been gained, the SNM approach is still an unfinished research programme. We identify various promising research directions, as well as policy implications.},

  abstract = {Cities are increasingly seen as the places where innovations that can trigger a sociotechnical transition toward urban mobility are emerging and maturing. Processes such as peak car, rail renaissance and cycling boom manifest themselves particularly in cities, and success stories of cities experimenting with specific types of low-energy mobility abound in the academic literature. Nonetheless, innovation is known to be a precarious process requiring favorable circumstances. Using document analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the nature of low-energy innovation in the everyday mobility of people in two UK cities with favorable conditions for a transition away from fossil fuels\textemdash Brighton and Oxford. It shows that clear differences exist between the two cities in the sorts of innovation that emerge and diffuse as a result of path dependencies, local politics, and financial support from supra-local governments and agencies. While low-energy mobility currently has substantial momentum in both cities, the majority of low-carbon innovations in urban mobility are incremental rather than radical in nature, and their future is often imbued with uncertainty. The autonomy of small- and medium-sized cities as agents in bringing about transformational change toward low-energy urban mobility should not be overestimated.},

The research objective is to identify and assess complete, multimodal journeys using Oyster smart card fare payment data in London. Three transfer combinations (bus-to-Underground, Underground-to-bus, and bus-to-bus) are considered to formulate recommendations for maximum elapsed time thresholds to identify transfers between journey stages for each passenger on the London network. Recommended elapsed time thresholds for identifying transfers are 20 min for Underground-to-bus, 35 min for bus-to-Underground, and 45 min for bus-to-bus, but a range of values that account for variability across the network are also assessed. Key findings about bus and Underground travel in London include an average of 2.3 daily public transportation journeys per passenger, 1.3 journey stages per public transportation journey, and 23\% of Underground journeys involving a transfer to or from a bus. The application of complete journey data to bus network planning is used to illustrate the value of new information that would be available to network planners through the use of smart card fare payment data.},

  abstract = {The challenges of sustainable development (and climate change and peak oil, in particular) demand system-wide transformations in sociotechnical systems of provision. An academic literature around coevolutionary innovation for sustainability has recently emerged as an attempt to understand the dynamics and directions of such sociotechnical transformations, which are termed `sustainability transitions'. This literature has previously focused on market-based technological innovations. Here we apply it to a new context of civil-society-based social innovation and examine the role of community-based initiatives in a transition to a low-carbon sustainable economy in the UK. We present new empirical research from a study of the UK's Transition Towns movement (a `grassroots innovation') and assess its attempts to grow and influence wider societal sociotechnical systems. By applying strategic niche management theory to this civil society context, we deliver theoretically informed practical recommendations for this movement to diffuse beyond its niche: to foster deeper engagement with resourceful regime actors; to manage expectations more realistically by delivering tangible opportunities for action and participation; and to embrace a community-based, action-oriented model of social change (in preference to a cognitive theory of behaviour change). Furthermore, our study indicates areas where theory can be refined to better explain the growth and broader impacts of grassroots innovations\textemdash namely, through a fuller appreciation of the importance of internal niche processes, by understanding the important role of identity and group formation, and by resolving how social practices change in grassroots innovations.},

Traditional carsharing, though expanding, has a limited network of vehicles and locations. The next generation of shared-use vehicle services could overcome such expansion barriers as capital costs and land use by incorporating new concepts like personal vehicle sharing. Personal vehicle sharing provides short-term access to privately-owned vehicles. As of May 2012, there were 33 personal vehicle sharing operators worldwide, with 10 active or in pilot phase, three planned, and four defunct in North America. Due to operator non-disclosure, personal vehicle sharing member numbers are currently unknown. The authors investigated personal vehicle sharing in North America by conducting 34 expert interviews. This research explores the development of personal vehicle sharing including business models, market opportunities, and service barriers to assess its early viability as a sustainable transportation mode and to provide a foundation for future research on the topic. Personal vehicle sharing has the potential to impact the transportation sector by increasing the availability and interconnectivity among modes and providing greater alternatives to vehicle ownership in more geographic locations.},

  abstract = {Several methodological approaches have been used to estimate distance in health service research. In this study, focusing on cardiac catheterization services, Euclidean, Manhattan, and the less widely known Minkowski distance metrics are used to estimate distances from patient residence to hospital. Distance metrics typically produce less accurate estimates than actual measurements, but each metric provides a single model of travel over a given network. Therefore, distance metrics, unlike actual measurements, can be directly used in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance is most often used, but unlikely the most appropriate metric. Minkowski distance is a more promising method. Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling.},

  abstract = {Commonly, frequency of social interaction is modelled as a function of an ego's socio-demographic characteristics and dyad characteristics of ego and alters. This study is based on the contention that proximity to alters and accessibility to services and degree of urbanization moderate this relationship. In addition, marking the contribution of this study to the literature, social interaction frequencies are dynamic and change over time. Therefore, face-to-face interaction frequencies are subjected to the history of interaction and distance dynamics between actors. By taking these aspects into account, important research questions can be addressed, for instance, would the frequency of meeting between an ego and an alter increase if the alter lives nearby now, but was previously located far away? Or how often would the ego meet an alter who was living nearby but moved to a more distant location now? The answers could provide important feedback to tie maintenance, strength, disappearances and social travel dynamics over time. This study draws from the concepts of path dependence, life course and accessibility and shows that history and accessibility indicators can explain part of the frequency of face-to-face interactions. Life cycle events were taken as triggers of these changes. Retrospective survey data are used for the analyses. Face-to-face social interaction frequency between egos and their alters was recorded before and after the life cycle event. A stepwise ordered logit model estimation reveals that social travel frequency can be better predicted when geographical indicators and path dependence are included in the model specification.},

Time geography, which examines human activities under various constraints in a space\textendash time context, provides a useful framework to analyze the complex spatio-temporal relationships among activities and interactions taking place in both physical and virtual spaces. However, virtual activities and interactions conducted via ICT have characteristics that cannot be properly represented and analyzed under the classical time-geographic framework.

In addition, this paper presents a space\textendash time geographic information system (GIS) design that is capable of organizing complex activity and interaction data as spatio-temporal processes in an integrated space\textendash time environment. This space\textendash time GIS design offers a useful analytical environment for researchers to study increasingly dynamic human activity and travel patterns in today's society and their implications toward changing travel demand patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives.},

  abstract = {High speed rail (HSR) is changing the overall travel accessibility of cities in China. There have been a number of studies of high speed rail in China. However, detailed spatiotemporal accessibility pattern of cities affected by the operation of high speed rail in China has not been reported. This study takes a timetable-based accessibility evaluation approach to analyze the changes in travel time, travel cost, and distance accessibility for each of the four main stages of HSR development in China: no HSR service in Stage 1 before August 2008, several HSR lines in Stage 2 between August 2008 and July 2011, reduced operating speed of HSR trains in Stage 3 between August 2011 and November 2012, and addition of new HSR lines and reduction of ticket fares in Stage 4 between December 2012 and January 2013. In addition to the ``corridor effect'' and the ``center-diffusion'' pattern, this paper investigates the impacts of HSR on changes in in-vehicle travel time and out-of-vehicle travel time with respect to the policy changes that reduced the operating speed of HSR trains, rearranged the train timetable, and lowered the ticket fare on HSR trains. The analysis results indicate the spatiotemporal pattern of Chinese cities affected by these policy changes. This study is useful for assessing HSR impacts on the accessibility of various cities across China as well as serving as a decision-making support to policies related to adjustments of HSR operation and planning of future HSR routes by considering the existing HSR and non-HSR railway lines.},

This is a useful visualization tool for the level of service of transport, e.g. difference in the level of service between regions or points in a network and its improvement in the course of time. The two previously proposed methods\textemdash multidimensional scaling (MDS) and network time-space mapping\textemdash have certain advantages and disadvantages. However, we observe that these methods are essentially the same, and the merits of both these methods can be combined to formulate a generalized solution. In this study, we first formulate the time-space mapping problem, which includes the key features of both of the above stated methods, and propose a generalized solution. We then apply this solution to the time-distances of Japan's railway networks to confirm its applicability.},

An analytical model with which to examine the intrinsic relationships between the volume of activities, the intensity of land use, and the modal split of generated trips is formulated on the basis of an idealized urban region that contains a city within radius R. The city land consists of that required for transportation and that for all other activities. Given hypothetical initial conditions, impacts of an increasing auto modal split are analyzed on the basis of three conceivable strategies to deal with the pressure to expand transportation facilities. The analysis shows that the modal split has a strong influence on volume of activities and land use intensity. A policy of infrastructure expansion to accommodate the increasing number of autos reduces the amount of land available for more fundamental activities that transport is intended to support, not displace. To prevent this displacement, land intensity of areas used for all other activities must increase. Otherwise, the options would be to relocate some activities from the city to outlying areas; such relocation could result in increasing traffic volumes in the entire region. Alternatively, the accommodation of other activities may encroach on previously protected or undevelopable land and lead to unsustainable development for the region. It is also shown that to maintain sustainability of a city, high-capacity transit modes with reserve capacity, such as rail transit systems, represent an efficient option in dense urban areas.},

  abstract = {With cooling costs rising exponentially, designing cooling solutions for worst-case power dissipation is prohibitively expensive. Chips that can autonomously modify their execution and power-dissipation characteristics permit the use of lower-cost cooling solutions while still guaranteeing safe temperature regulation. Evaluating techniques for this dynamic thermal management (DTM), however, requires a thermal model that is practical for architectural studies.This paper describes HotSpot, an accurate yet fast and practical model based on an equivalent circuit of thermal resistances and capacitances that correspond to microarchitecture blocks and essential aspects of the thermal package. Validation was performed using finite-element simulation. The paper also introduces several effective methods for DTM: "temperature-tracking" frequency scaling, "migrating computation" to spare hardware units, and a "hybrid" policy that combines fetch gating with dynamic voltage scaling. The latter two achieve their performance advantage by exploiting instruction-level parallelism, showing the importance of microarchitecture research in helping control the growth of cooling costs.Modeling temperature at the microarchitecture level also shows that power metrics are poor predictors of temperature, that sensor imprecision has a substantial impact on the performance of DTM, and that the inclusion of lateral resistances for thermal diffusion is important for accuracy.},

  abstract = {Location, as the fundamental concept in geography, is important for all sciences that study objects and behaviours in geo-space. Although other disciplines are capable of formulating definitions of location and geo-space, they nevertheless look up to geography to devise and articulate a comprehensive and practical concept of `everything geographic'. Essentially quantitative in its concern, geography has yet to quantify the concept of geo-space in order to both fulfil the ancient Greeks' vision of geography and advance it for use in other disciplines. We revisit the epistemological and broader philosophical principles of geo-space and apply these principles to identifying and quantifying the key aspects of geo-space: topos, choros and geos. Rather than following the narrow numerical tradition of quantitative geography and GIS, we adopt broader philosophical perspective of Kant on Quantity (Unity, Multiplicity, Totality) and argue that the `natural' extension of the classical approach to geo-space necessitates its further philosophical quantification. We show that the ancient Greeks' concept maps into locations (topos), spatial relations (choros) and topology (geos). Extending the concept further necessitates the use of the language of set theory for defining basic concepts. We show that the result is both tractable and quantifiable, connects classical with modern and completes the definition of geo-space on all three levels of Quantity (unity, multiplicity, totality). We demonstrate the tractability of thus defined concept by reinterpreting Tobler's First Law of geography in theoretically sound terms. We show that a refined, modern concept of geo-space is both philosophically fulfilling and practically useful \textendash{} some properties of geo-space are too important to be ignored or distorted.},

She profiles some of the most significant walkers in history and fiction-from Wordsworth to Gary Snyder, from Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet to Andre Breton's Nadja-finding a profound relationship between walking and thinking and walking and culture. Solnit argues for the necessity of preserving the time and space in which to walk in our ever more car-dependent and accelerated world.},

  abstract = {Activity centers are areas of strong development of a particular activity, such as residence, employment, or services. Understanding the subway system impacts on the type, combination, distribution and totally the development of basic activities in these centers, have an important role in managing development opportunities created along the Tehran subway lines. The multi criteria and fuzzy nature of evaluating the activity centers development make the issue as complex as cannot be addressed with conventional logical systems. One of the most important methods of multi criteria evaluation is Fuzzy Inference System. Fuzzy inference system is a popular computing framework based on the concepts of Fuzzy Sets Theory, which is capable of accommodating inherent uncertainty in multi-criteria evaluation process. This paper analyze shifts in activity centers along two lines of the Tehran subway system based on three major criteria by designing a comprehensive fuzzy inference system. The data for the present study were collected through documentary analysis, questionnaires and semi-structured interview. The result revealed that the level of the subway system influence on the pattern and process of the development of activities varied with the location, physical environment and entity of each station. Furthermore, empirical findings indicated that the subway line might weaken residential activities while attracting employment and service activities to the city center. Specifically, residential estates moved away from the city center to the suburbs whereas employment and service activities expanded from the existing central business district (CBD). The results can be applied to suggest planning policies aiming at improving the effects of public transit on property developemnet and land use change in a developing country.},

  abstract = {Transit-oriented development (TOD), first coined and mainly applied in the US, has received increasing interest in Europe over the past two decades as a sort of reinterpretation of typical intrinsic European planning principles and values. In the Old continent, it especially focuses on transport and land use integration, extending the approach from the local to the regional framework. This regional shift implies an intergovernmental cooperative approach with vertical and horizontal institutional coordination that constitutes both a strategic value and one of the main barriers to the implementation of TOD. This paper focuses on the role of regional planning for TOD by analysing its benefits, tools and barriers, both theoretically and through two European case studies. The latter, which were conducted in the Netherlands and in Italy, were selected as they belong to two different ``planning families'', in order to underscore how and to what extent they apply this multi-level governance approach and overcome institutional barriers to the implementation of TOD. The analysis reveals that, albeit the two planning styles lead to different results, the main issue remains the deep coordination of land use and transport, which is hard to achieve despite dedicated efforts.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the quest for a more sustainable urban planning and street design has gained importance among practitioners and researchers. An urbanism oriented towards rail is a valid alternative to the long standing practices of urban planning and street lay out based on the individual car, which have conditioned the development of cities for several decades. Among different tools that could be implemented to improve rail travel attractiveness, a radical improvement of walking conditions all along the footpaths leading to rail stations is proposed. In this paper, an observation grid as well as a set of criteria for footpath attractiveness are first proposed as a tool (or methodological approach) for a spatial diagnosis. This tool is then tested on the Carnot rail station in Saint-Etienne, a city in Eastern France. Besides the assessment itself (showing assets and challenges of the areas to be redesigned), this case study leads to proposed planning principles, in terms of recommendations meant to improve footpath quality significantly.},

After an analysis of systemwide impacts, detailed research at two stations was performed with mail-back surveys, license plate surveys, and focus groups. The primary finding is that introduction of daily parking fees did not cause significant changes in access mode choice, facility location, or line-haul mode of park-and-ride users. New, higher-fee, daily reserved spaces were popular substitutes for monthly reserved spaces. The increased availability of parking spaces shifted arrival times later in the morning at the two stations. Even with user fees, for most trips to regional central business districts the overall cost of using a park-andride facility and BART still remained well below the cost of the trip made by automobile only. Overall BART ridership and ridership at those stations where new fees were introduced, remained unchanged.},

Institutional barriers play a key role here, and the literature provides an overview of the most important ones and ways of overcoming them. Yet, application of such insights remains elusive, due to the context-specific nature of barriers. As a first and necessary step to cope with the implementation challenge of TODS, this paper proposes an approach to identify barriers within a given context. The approach is applied to a hypothesis-generating case, the Netherlands. The findings indicate a vicious cycle of mutually reinforcing formal and informal barriers hampering implementation. The approach could be useful for cities elsewhere that face similar implementation difficulties.},

The aim of the procedure is two-fold: firstly, the method is to be used as an objective measure for comparing stations in order to detect suboptimal points and improve the performance of stations as nodal points; secondly, the method provides a means to embed intermodality into regional accessibility models, allowing comprehensive modelling at lower scales. The empirical base of the work comprises data from 27 European high speed rail stations, which is deemed an appropriate statistical sample for the whole European rail network. Using the entropy metric, we found that several different patterns emerged: there was a clear hierarchy of stations which was linked to their respective roles within the system, while strong constraints impeded stations from performing optimally as true intermodal nodes.},

Many of such tools and indicators have been developed in recent years, but not so many are implemented in practice. In this paper a new, participatory development approach for planning support systems (PSS) is proposed, termed "mediated planning support" (MPS) that addresses bottlenecks blocking this implementation. It is founded on insights from knowledge management, system dynamics and software innovation and is applied in the Greater Region of Amsterdam. This paper discusses the evolution of the PSS, highlighting the most useful elements which can be applied in other land use and transport planning projects. It offers insights for practitioners and researchers interested in land use and transport planning integration and for professionals that are dealing with supporting planning with information and technologies.},

The findings suggest a number of factors complicating policy transfer, and that `softer' transferable lessons (e.g., good actor relationships, information sharing) are much more difficult to transfer than `harder' technical tools. Using policy lessons and tools in learning exercises helps to develop contextually appropriate policy solutions.},

These forces sharpen social segregation, which is reflected in fragmented social network structure. Geographical impediments such as distance and physical or administrative boundaries also reinforce social segregation. Yet, less is known about the joint relationships between social network structure, urban geography, and inequality. In this paper we analyze an online social network and find that the fragmentation of social networks is significantly higher in towns in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as rivers and railroads. Towns in which neighborhoods are relatively distant from the center of town and amenities are spatially concentrated are also more socially segregated. Using a two-stage model, we show that these urban geography features have significant relationships with income inequality via social network fragmentation. In other words, the geographic features of a place can compound economic inequalities via social networks.},

We argue here that the smart city policy agenda should be informed by and address the structure of transnational urban networks as this can affect the efficiency of such local policies. The significance of this global network structure is essential as cities do not exist in a vacuum. On the contrary, urban development is heavily based on urban interdependencies found at a global scale. After critically analyzing smart city characteristics and the world city network literature, we identify the need for global urban interdependencies to be addressed in a smart city policy framework. While this paper approaches this issue from a theoretical standpoint, some policy examples are also provided.},

This phenomenon started with the `Euralille' project, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas at the end of the eighties and built in 1995.The project is part of a group of major French projects such as the central business districts: La D\'efense in Paris and La Part\-Dieu in Lyon, which are characterised by infrastructural interventions as the basis for urban renewal. France was the first country in Europe \textendash{} back in the seventies \textendash{} to invest in developing highs-peed lines; their TGV (train \`a grande vitesse) became the role model for comparable developments in other countries. The Euralille Metropole grand projet (as these major projects were known) provided a context for upgrading the Lille-Flandres terminal (with regional railways and TGV services to Paris), constructing Lille-Europe (with international HSL services) and the provision of car parking, links to the metro network and urban amenities.},

  abstract = {In contemporary mobile society, stations are becoming much more than just a place to get on and off trains or other modes of transport. Stations are places to work, do business, meet, shop and relax. They not only link different modes of transport at several levels (local, regional, national and international) but are also `urban' connectors within the city and its surrounding region, as well as catalysts of urban transformation. A development or redevelopment project for a station can therefore also be used to promote high-quality architecture and the revitalization of city districts. The main goals are on the one hand finding an optimum mix of transport modalities for every situation and making the whole station complex as seamless as possible for the users, and on the other to address the need to rethink the `intermodal station' as an urban place, as an attractive and liveable area with room for `innovative' design solutions as well as development and redevelopment projects and densification. This means that a higher degree of flexibility must be incorporated, finding ways to deal with the often complicated governance structure inside and outside the station building and its surroundings.},

Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point\textemdash in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality\textemdash constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c) that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action.},

  abstract = {Vehicle electrification is a promising approach towards attaining green transportation. However, the absence of charging stations limits the penetration of electric vehicles. Current approaches for optimizing the locations of charging stations suffer from challenges associated with spatial\textendash temporal dynamic travel demands and the lengthy period required for the charging process. The present article uses the electric taxi (ET) as an example to develop a spatial\textendash temporal demand coverage approach for optimizing the placement of ET charging stations in the space\textendash time context. To this end, public taxi demands with spatial and temporal attributes are extracted from massive taxi GPS data. The cyclical interactions between taxi demands, ETs, and charging stations are modeled with a spatial\textendash temporal path tool. A location model is developed to maximize the level of ET service on the road network and the level of charging service at the stations under spatial and temporal constraints such as the ET range, the charging time, and the capacity of charging stations. The reduced carbon emission generated by used ETs with located charging stations is also evaluated. An experiment conducted in Shenzhen, China demonstrates that the proposed approach not only exhibits good performance in determining ET charging station locations by considering temporal attributes, but also achieves a high quality trade-off between the levels of ET service and charging service. The proposed approach and obtained results help the decision-making of urban ET charging station siting.},

  abstract = {In a cartogram, the map elements are purposely modified with respect to an attribute. A time cartogram is a type of cartogram in which the geographic-distance between locations is replaced by a time-related attribute such as travelling-time, deforming the geography accordingly. This study concentrates on centred time cartograms that visualize travelling-times from a fixed starting location to other locations in the region. Several methods to construct time cartograms have been proposed, however these methods are not entirely satisfactory. In particular, none of them describes how to deform both the network and the map's boundaries based on travelling-times, which is necessary to maintain recognizability. In many cases, homeomorphism and topology are not maintained. The resultant maps from such methods are highly deformed and are difficult to read. Some of these methods are computationally demanding, while the procedures of others are not fully described. We present a method to construct time cartograms for the visual representation of scheduled movement data using the Dutch railways network as a case study. The method was developed by approaching the construction of time cartograms as a two-step process. In the first step, vector calculus is used to displace the train stations according to travelling-times from a fixed starting station. In the second step, moving-least-squares based affine deformation is applied to deform the railroads and the map's boundaries accordingly. To enhance understanding, concentric circles are drawn from the starting station to depict travelling-times. The method maintains homeomorphism and topology and yields time cartograms that are easily recognizable.},

Sur la base du constat que le syst\`eme de transports n'est pas durable, nous effectuons une approche par les co\^uts de la mobilit\'e \`a partir de trois indicateurs repr\'esentatifs de la durabilit\'e de la mobilit\'e des m\'enages : les co\^uts annuels de la mobilit\'e urbaine des m\'enages, le taux d'effort annuel consacr\'e par les m\'enages pour leurs d\'epenses de transports et leurs \'emissions annuelles de CO2. Le lien entre forme urbaine et mobilit\'e n'est pas simple. Il s'agit d'un lien de r\'eciprocit\'e complexe \`a d\'efinir. Les travaux montrent que trois dimensions de l'environnement local jouent au final sur la mobilit\'e des m\'enages : la densit\'e, la diversit\'e et l'accessibilit\'e. La d\'emarche consiste \`a confronter les facteurs suppos\'es explicatifs des indicateurs de durabilit\'e de la mobilit\'e des m\'enages et de d\'eterminer quelle est la part expliqu\'ee par la forme urbaine. Sur le p\'erim\`etre \'elargi de l'enqu\^ete m\'enages de Lyon (2006), notre approche par les co\^uts de la mobilit\'e des m\'enages permet une approche des in\'egalit\'es sur le plan financier.

Afin de d\'eterminer la part des co\^uts de la mobilit\'e expliqu\'ee par la forme urbaine, nous b\^atissons des mod\`eles explicatifs au niveau du m\'enage en y int\'egrant des variables de forme urbaine et des variables socio-\'economiques du m\'enage. L'analyse met aussi en \'evidence l'influence des p\^oles secondaires sur la vuln\'erabilit\'e des m\'enages et les co\^uts de la mobilit\'e. Les mod\`eles par type de m\'enages montrent enfin que les effets de la forme urbaine sont diff\'erenci\'es suivant les types de m\'enage. Il est \'egalement int\'eressant de mesurer les \'economies g\'en\'er\'ees par des changements marginaux de forme urbaine. Nous b\^atissons pour cela des mod\`eles \'econom\'etriques \`a un niveau plus agr\'eg\'e permettant le calcul de coefficients d'\'elasticit\'e. En outre nous pouvons estimer en termes \'economiques les gains esp\'er\'es suite \`a des changements de forme urbaine.},

  abstract = {A study of the frequency and nature of multitasking on Dutch trains is described. Descriptive and model analyses were carried out on the basis of field observations on intercity and regional trains. The most frequent task was "doing nothing," followed by "talking socially" and "reading a newspaper." On average, most time was spent in "study," followed by "reading a book," and "puzzles." A multinomial logistic regression model that describes the relationship between the probability of conducting a particular task and several personal and travel context variables is estimated. The most important variables that influence probability of the distinguished tasks are the presence of accompanying persons, age of traveler, travel day, type of train, crowdedness of train, and time of day. This type of information is useful for train companies to improve service quality and design marketing efforts and pricing regimes.},

  abstract = {Urban living labs (ULLs) are emerging as a form of collective urban governance and experimentation to address sustainability challenges and opportunities created by urbanisation. ULLs have different goals, they are initiated by various actors, and they form different types of partnerships. There is no uniform ULL definition. However, many projects studying and testing living lab methodologies are focusing on urban sustainability and low carbon challenges, as demonstrated by the current projects funded by the Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) Urban Europe. At the same time, there is no clear understanding of what the ultimate role of ULLs is in urban governance, and whether they represent a completely new phenomenon that is replacing other forms of participation, collaboration, experimentation, learning and governing in cities. There is a need to clarify what makes the ULL approach attractive and novel. The aim of this article is to develop current understandings through an examination of how the ULL concept is being operationalised in contemporary urban governance for sustainability and low carbon cities. This is undertaken through the analysis of academic literature complemented with five snapshot case studies of major ongoing ULL projects funded by JPI Urban Europe. Five key ULL characteristics are identified and elaborated: geographical embeddedness, experimentation and learning, participation and user involvement, leadership and ownership, and evaluation and refinement. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda that highlights four key topics: ways in which the ULL approach is operationalised, the nature of ULL partnerships and the role of research institutions, the types of challenges addressed by different ULLs, and the role of sustainability and low carbon issues in framing ULLs.},

  abstract = {In order to attract more choice riders, transit service must not only have a high level of service in terms of frequency and travel time but also must be reliable. Although transit agencies continuously work to improve on-time performance, such efforts often come at a substantial cost. One inexpensive way to combat the perception of unreliability from the user perspective is real-time transit information. The OneBusAway transit traveler information system provides real-time next bus countdown information for riders of King County Metro via website, telephone, text-messaging, and smart phone applications. Although previous studies have looked at traveler response to real-time information, few have addressed real-time information via devices other than public display signs. For this study, researchers observed riders arriving at Seattle-area bus stops to measure their wait time while asking a series of questions, including how long they perceived that they had waited. The study found that for riders without real-time information, perceived wait time is greater than measured wait time. However, riders using real-time information do not perceive their wait time to be longer than their measured wait time. This is substantiated by the typical wait times that riders report. Real-time information users say that their average wait time is 7.5min versus 9.9min for those using traditional arrival information, a difference of about 30\%. A model to predict the perceived wait time of bus riders was developed, with significant variables that include the measured wait time, an indicator variable for real-time information, an indicator variable for PM peak period, the bus frequency in buses per hour, and a self-reported typical aggravation level. The addition of real-time information decreases the perceived wait time by 0.7min (about 13\%). A critical finding of the study is that mobile real-time information reduces not only the perceived wait time, but also the actual wait time experienced by customers. Real-time information users in the study wait almost 2min less than those arriving using traditional schedule information. Mobile real-time information has the ability to improve the experience of transit riders by making the information available to them before they reach the stop.},

  abstract = {Everyone knows the small-world phenomenon: soon after meeting a stranger, we are surprised to discover that we have a mutual friend, or we are connected through a short chain of acquaintances. In his book, Duncan Watts uses this intriguing phenomenon--colloquially called "six degrees of separation"--as a prelude to a more general exploration: under what conditions can a small world arise in any kind of network? The networks of this story are everywhere: the brain is a network of neurons; organisations are people networks; the global economy is a network of national economies, which are networks of markets, which are in turn networks of interacting producers and consumers. Food webs, ecosystems, and the Internet can all be represented as networks, as can strategies for solving a problem, topics in a conversation, and even words in a language. Many of these networks, the author claims, will turn out to be small worlds. How do such networks matter? Simply put, local actions can have global consequences, and the relationship between local and global dynamics depends critically on the network's structure. Watts illustrates the subtleties of this relationship using a variety of simple models---the spread of infectious disease through a structured population; the evolution of cooperation in game theory; the computational capacity of cellular automata; and the sychronisation of coupled phase-oscillators. Watts's novel approach is relevant to many problems that deal with network connectivity and complex systems' behaviour in general: How do diseases (or rumours) spread through social networks? How does cooperation evolve in large groups? How do cascading failures propagate through large power grids, or financial systems? What is the most efficient architecture for an organisation, or for a communications network? This fascinating exploration will be fruitful in a remarkable variety of fields, including physics and mathematics, as well as sociology, economics, and biology.},

Despite technological innovation, finite fossil fuel reserves will in the long run lead to increasing costs of transport. Moreover, to fight global warming many governments have set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, and to achieve them fossil fuels must become more expensive either through market developments or by political intervention. This paper gives an overview about the drivers, feedbacks and constraints of urban mobility and location in a possible future in which transport energy will no longer be abundant and cheap. It asks whether current urban models are able to adequately model the impacts of significantly higher transport costs and demonstrates by an example how it can be done.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that there is a powerful tendency in forecasting of socio-technical change to focus on the causes and consequences of change at the cost of greater understanding of the reasons for and significance of continuity. Taking the case of the global automotive industry, the paper therefore analyses the evidence for systemic continuity in technologies, economic structures, cultural positioning and embedded social function through the lens of transition theory and the multi-level perspective. It is concluded that the observable processes are as much about enduring technologies and social practices as they are about systemic change. That is, the industry has shown resistance to change notwithstanding the apparent imperatives for radical action or the multitude of attempts via socio-technical experimentation to nurture strategic niches. At a theoretical level, it is concluded that greater attention must be paid to understanding how change can be nullified. Moreover, theoretical expectations of systemic change need a greater emphasis on the way in which technological transition as a process may mean that many existing practices and structures are retained more or less intact rather than entirely replaced by new practices and structures. The future research agenda needs therefore to understand more fully how embedded practices and technological change inter-relate in specific concrete conditions.},

  abstract = {In 2016, Carlos Moreno proposed the concept of ``15-minute cities'' based on the principles of proximity, diversity, density, and ubiquity. In fact, he re-formulated (``re-invented'') some of the already existing planning principles, making them recognized and desired by non-professionals. Moreno, however, paid little attention to the external connectivity of neighborhoods, assuming that most needs would be satisfied locally. This paper aims to discuss the concept of ``15-minute cities'' from the transport planning point of view and investigate how the concept can contribute to such planning. The research review conducted in this paper suggests that similar actions in the past caused a modal shift from the use of cars to public transport, rather than a radical limitation of total transport needs. To simplify, if a neighborhood is well designed, people are more likely to walk, ride a bike, and use public transport, but the majority will still commute outside of the neighborhood for work. In the metropolis of the ideal ``15-minute city'', Barcelona, the majority of the inhabitants travel to work either by car or public transport, which proves that they need to move outside the neighborhood. This leads us to the conclusions that (1) ``15-minute cities'' should incorporate the transit-oriented development concept and include public transport nodes, such as railways or underground stations, as the central point of walkable, multifunctional neighborhoods, and (2) railway/underground station planners should pay more attention to the creation of a proper mix of services at and around the stations according to ``15-minute cities'' principles. In the future, there should also be more emphasis on re-allocating workplaces to neighborhoods, as well as on researching the actual impact of the (improved and current) ``15-minute cities'' design on transport volumes.},

  abstract = {It has been necessary to relax all of the assumptions of economic rationality in order to interpret the spatial variations in the labor productivity achieved by Middle Sweden's farmers. As a group, the sample population does not achieve profit maximization, nor are its goals directed solely to that objective. Perfect knowledge is denied by the existence of unpredictable change and lag in the communication and perception of information. The decision behavior reflects not only the objective alternatives which are available, but also man's awareness of these alternatives and the consequences of their outcomes, his degree of aversion to risk and uncertainty and his system of values. The concept of the spatial satisfier appears more descriptively accurate of the behavioral pattern of the sample population than the normative concept of Economic Man. The individual is adaptively or intendedly rational rather than omnisciently rational. Alternatives are considered which are conspicuous (i.e., about which he has received information). To avoid uncertainty, he attempts to emphasize short-run reactions to information feedback and to arrange a negotiated environment.32 If the distribution of the individual farmers is considered and allowances are made for spatial lags in the communication process, variations in aspiration levels, in the inherent instability of planning environments and in attitudes toward the avoidance of risk, then the spatial variations in farming activities, productivity and income may be more Clearly understood. The framework of matched comparison between Middle Sweden's farmers and Economic Man was designed with several purposes a mind. The initial objective was to demonstrate the inappropriateness of the rational model in explaining the variations in productivity. A secondary purpose was to locate regions of "maladjustment" or "disequilibrium" where resource restrictions or organizational and technical gaps limit the attainment of come parity. The primary emphasis, however, has been devoted to the third objective to substitute for economic rationality and its assumptions of optimizing behavior and omni science, a more descriptive behavioral theory which allows for a range of decisions behavior and spatial variations in decision environments.},

Ces trois bilans sont \'etablis \`a partir d'une comparaison des co\^uts d'infrastructure, des co\^uts des syst\`emes de conduite, des co\^uts de mat\'eriel roulant, des co\^uts d'exploitation, des co\^uts financiers du projet dus au temps d'essai et d'int\'egration et de l'impact de la fr\'equence sur la client\`ele. Les r\'esultats et leurs variations en fonction des diff\'erents facteurs contribuant \`a ces bilans sont donc examin\'es. Selon cette \'etude, les facteurs ayant l'influence la plus forte sur ces bilans sont les co\^uts d'infrastructure, les co\^uts des automatismes, les co\^uts de personnel, le co\^ut des d\'elais li\'es aux essais et \`a l'int\'egration du syst\`eme et les surplus de recettes li\'es \`a l'attractivit\'e exerc\'ee sur la client\`ele par la qualit\'e de service \'elev\'ee apport\'ee par les syst\`emes \`a conduite automatique int\'egrale. Les bilans sont plus favorables pour les lignes \'equip\'ees de rames courtes et de petit gabarit, avec une fr\'equence \'elev\'ee, qui demandent des stations courtes, un parc de v\'ehicules important, et un nombre \'elev\'e de conducteurs.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the socio-economic impacts of the driving restriction zone policy for the Paris region, using the multi-agent transport simulation MATSim. Based on a previous work which has calibrated a first instantiation of the mobility model to the Paris region, we extend it by modeling and simulating two forms of intermodality: Park-and-Walk and Park-and-Ride. After re-calibrating the model, we evaluate two policy scenarios featuring different scales of the restriction zone, using indicators related to mobility, traffic emissions, and social cost. The analysis puts special attention on how modal shift and emissions vary across space, that is, inside and outside the policy zone. We find that the small-scale scenario with a restriction zone limited to the Paris center leads to very limited modal shift, whereas the larger-scale policy scenario encompassing the whole of Paris shifts significantly more trips (about 1.4\% of total trips) from cars to public transport and other modes. In both scenarios, traffic emissions decline in the restriction zone and its near surroundings. Far from the restriction zone, however, emissions increase in the small-scale scenario but decrease in the large-scale scenario. These differences are caused by the traffic detour, modal shift, and rebound effects, the magnitudes of which vary depending on the scale of the restriction zone. The driving restrictions also cause the social cost to increase by around 10\% in both scenarios. This ultimately implies a trade-off between reducing emissions and increasing user costs, with a substantially greater efficiency (larger reduction for similar cost) in the large-scale policy scenario.},

  abstract = {This article provides an overview of the development of space-time modeling in Geographic Information Science (GIScience). Distinguished from mathematical modeling of space and time, GIScience approach addresses conceptualization, representation, and database modeling of spatiotemporal constructs to support spatiotemporal query and analysis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Much GIScience progress in spatiotemporal modeling parallels to the database development. However, the added complexity of geographic properties and structures present a wide range of challenges to properly and sufficiently conceptualize space and time in geographic worlds and how the conceptualization may be implemented in a GIS environment. The fundamental question of what constitutes a geographic object and how to recognize and handle the persistency of the same object is non-trivial in GIScience. The article discusses the conventional time-stamp approaches to space-time modeling of geographic information and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of time-stamped models. These time-stamped approaches employ concepts of valid time, transaction time, and user-defined time to roll-back to the previous states of a database or to support historical queries about geographic worlds. Furthermore, much research progress has been made to capture geographic events, processes, and dynamics in geographic domains. The article overviews these developments and suggests research directions of GIScience approaches in space-time modeling.},

  abstract = {Public transportation systems (PTSs) play an important role in modern cities, providing shared/massive transportation services that are essential for the general public. However, due to their increasing complexity, designing effective methods to visualize and explore PTS is highly challenging. Most existing techniques employ network visualization methods and focus on showing the network topology across stops while ignoring various mobility-related factors such as riding time, transfer time, waiting time, and round-the-clock patterns. This work aims to visualize and explore passenger mobility in a PTS with a family of analytical tasks based on inputs from transportation researchers. After exploring different design alternatives, we come up with an integrated solution with three visualization modules: isochrone map view for geographical information, isotime flow map view for effective temporal information comparison and manipulation, and OD-pair journey view for detailed visual analysis of mobility factors along routes between specific origin-destination pairs. The isotime flow map linearizes a flow map into a parallel isoline representation, maximizing the visualization of mobility information along the horizontal time axis while presenting clear and smooth pathways from origin to destinations. Moreover, we devise several interactive visual query methods for users to easily explore the dynamics of PTS mobility over space and time. Lastly, we also construct a PTS mobility model from millions of real passenger trajectories, and evaluate our visualization techniques with assorted case studies with the transportation researchers.},

  abstract = {L'actuelle augmentation des vitesses de d\'eplacements, observ\'ee par les Enqu\^etes Globales des Transports en \^Ile-de-France, constitue l'indicateur le plus significatif de la croissance de la mobilit\'e urbaine. Cette acc\'el\'eration, g\'en\'erale et soutenue, ne r\'eduit ni la dur\'ee des d\'eplacements ni les \'ecarts entre les vitesses des d\'eplacements. Elle entra\^ine, en revanche, un allongement proportionnel de la port\'ee des d\'eplacements et une diff\'erenciation croissante des vitesses. Etroitement li\'ee aux deux tendances majeures de l'urbanisation en cours - la motorisation et l'\'etalement urbain - l'\'evolution des vitesses de d\'eplacement constitue un \'el\'ement explicatif du d\'eveloppement urbain dans ses dimensions spatiale, \'economique et sociale. Fond\'e sur une analyse d\'etaill\'ee des caract\'eristiques de la croissance de la mobilit\'e urbaine en Europe, ce travail de th\`ese s'int\'eresse aux possibilit\'es d'intervention sur l'organisation de l'espace urbain offertes par le contr\^ole de la vitesse de d\'eplacement. Il interroge d'abord les principes et les d\'emarches des contr\^oles de vitesse mis en place par les pouvoirs publics. L'\'etude de la limitation r\'eglementaire de la vitesse de circulation automobile montre que, m\^eme si l'actuel contr\^ole peut conduire \`a une baisse effective de la vitesse de circulation, il n'a pourtant que peu d'effets sur les vitesses de d\'eplacement. La d\'efaillance du contr\^ole public sur la vitesse de d\'eplacement explique la faible capacit\'e de la planification urbaine existante \`a orienter le d\'eveloppement de la ville contemporaine. Dans un contexte de relance de la planification urbaine en Europe, cette th\`ese tente de valoriser certaines exp\'eriences ayant explicitement appr\'ehend\'e le contr\^ole de la vitesse de d\'eplacement comme outil d'organisation de l'espace urbain. En soulignant les enjeux que le contr\^ole apporte pour la d\'efinition des objectifs et des probl\'ematiques de la planification territoriale, elle propose d'int\'egrer ce nouvel outil dans les dispositifs de gouvernance urbaine et met en avant des modalit\'es d'insertion possibles.},
